 * anchors_zero_fee_htlc_tx, optionally with scid_alias (+zero_conf, which

 * commitment stage fails closed), and a negotiation that is guaranteed to
 * die later must be refused at admission, before keys are derived, state
 * is retained or an ACCEPT_CHANNEL2 is sent.
 *
 * BOLT 2 makes channel_type REQUIRED on open_channel2 (unlike the legacy
 * open, where it is optional), so an absent or empty value is refused
 * outright, as is a non-minimal encoding (leading zero bytes): two
 * different byte strings for one type would let the echo check be
 * satisfied by a value the commitment dispatch reads differently.
 *
 * Every bit is additionally held to BOTH feature vectors when the caller
 * supplies them, per BOLT 2's rule that a channel_type must not carry
 * un-negotiated features (the default vector advertises scid_alias and
 * zero_conf, so this costs nothing between our own nodes; zero-conf
 * ACCEPTANCE stays separately gated on the trusted set where the type is
 * adopted). A vector the caller does not have (raw Channel harnesses,
 * manager-less drivers) skips only its own half of that check.
