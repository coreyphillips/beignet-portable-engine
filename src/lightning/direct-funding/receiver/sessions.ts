/**
 * Per-instance receiver state: offer sessions and outpoint reservations
 * (issue #612).
 *
 * Both were MODULE-level maps in the fork, shared by every node in the
 * process, pruned only from inside the offer handler and capped only by an
 * in-flight counter that was itself off by one (defects D15, D16). Here they
 * belong to one engine instance, a timer sweeps them whether or not offers are
 * arriving, and the map itself has a ceiling.
 *
 * The per-request attempt budget is deliberately NOT here: it has to survive a
 * restart, so it lives on the request record itself (DirectFundingRequestStore
 * beginAttempt/endAttempt), whose life it was already bound to.
