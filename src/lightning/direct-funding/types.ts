/**
 * Third-party direct funding: shared types, limits and refusals (issue #610,
 * LFBW port #532 workstream 4A).
 *
 * The protocol authority for every byte in this directory is
 * "Third-Party Direct Funding of Lightning Channels" revision 2 (the bLIP
 * draft circulated with the LFBW app). An unrelated payer's on-chain payment
 * becomes the receiver's channel funding transaction directly: the receiver
 * mints a signed request envelope, hands it out inside a BIP 21 URI, and the
 * payer contributes its input to a dual-funded open after verifying, in the
 * exact bytes it signs, that its coin funds a channel output the receiver's
 * node key attested.
 *
 * This module is the substrate: the envelope codec (rev 2 "The payment
 * request envelope"), the sealed frame layer (rev 2 "Frame encryption"), the
 * six message codecs (rev 2 "The funding protocol") and the durable request
 * record (rev 2 "Request lifecycle requirements"). It reads and writes no
 * transport and touches no channel.
