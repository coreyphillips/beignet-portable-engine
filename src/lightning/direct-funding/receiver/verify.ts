 * address key (LND's SignMessageWithAddr, Core's signmessage, Electrum,
 * hardware signers). When the offer carries the message form it is the one
 * verified and the digest field is expected to be zeros; a receiver that
 * predates the message form never sees it (odd TLV) and declines on the
 * zeros, before any negotiation.
 *
 * Rev 2 notes a final specification may adopt BIP 322 wholesale. We do not,
 * and only the two script kinds `scriptKind` classifies are admitted, because
