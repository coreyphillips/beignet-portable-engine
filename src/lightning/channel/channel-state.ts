	 * rate limited and providers need not return the latest blob
	 * (docs/RECOVERY-PROTOCOL.md 5.4), so a Tier 2 restore is byte-identical
	 * to a checkpoint that may be behind what this node actually did. 5.4 names
	 * `channel_reestablish` as the safety net for exactly that, and it is: an
	 * honest peer's counters expose the gap and route the channel to DLP. But
	 * the safety net only covers the paths that reach it, and the AUTOMATIC
	 * force-close paths do not - a peer's BOLT 1 error, the reestablish and
	 * errored timeout backstops, the HTLC deadline backstops. Each of those
	 * would broadcast a commitment the peer may already hold a revocation for,
	 * which forfeits the whole balance to the justice path.
	 *
	 * So while this is set the node refuses to broadcast our commitment ON ITS
	 * OWN INITIATIVE, and it stays set. A COMPATIBLE reestablish does not lift
	 * it: BOLT 2's stale-state proof runs one way only, and the peer holding
	 * our capsule is the same peer we would be trusting, so one that holds a
	 * newer state can under-report compatible counters, replay the old secret
	 * it already has, and wait for an automatic close to publish a commitment
	 * it can penalize. The hold IS the defence against that, because the
	 * attack needs us to broadcast.
	 *
	 * It is still deliberately NOT `stateUncertain`, which routes reestablish
	 * itself to DLP and would force-close every capsule restore: this channel
	 * RESUMES and keeps its funds. What it does not do is take NEW HTLCs. Its
	 * on-chain HTLC deadline backstops can never fire while the hold stands,
	 * and accepting an obligation whose only enforcement this node has disarmed
	 * is how a bounded risk becomes an unbounded one; existing HTLCs still
	 * settle and fail off chain.
	 *
	 * Nor does it close COOPERATIVELY. That was once argued here as safe
	 * because a mutual close involves no revocation, and that is true and
	 * beside the point: a mutual close pays out the balances THIS row carries,
	 * and a stale capsule's allocation can only ever be the peer-favourable
	 * one, since any payment received after the checkpoint is missing from it.
	 * A peer holding the newer state can under-report compatible reestablish
	 * counters, ask to close, and validly sign the older split; signing it is a
	 * loss with no penalty attached and no way back. Both directions are
	 * refused, and a locally initiated close takes the same labelled
	 * acknowledgement the operator force close does.
	 *
