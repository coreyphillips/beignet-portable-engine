/**
 * Dual-funding contribution selection: which IFundingProvider method funds a
 * v2 open, and what to do when the configured provider predates it.
 *
 * Three sites fund a dual-funding contribution from the on-chain wallet: the
 * opener's auto-funding, a lease seller's acceptor contribution and an RBF
 * contribution raise. All three route through here so the method preference
 * and the fallback live in one place rather than being re-spelled (and drifting
 * apart) at each site.
 *
 * Type-only imports by design: channel/channel-manager consumes this module at
 * runtime while node/types references channel/channel-manager, so keeping this
 * a leaf with no runtime imports keeps that edge free of a cycle. (bitcoinjs
 * below is an external package, not part of that edge.)
