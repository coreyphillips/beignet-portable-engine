/**
 * What the payer checks in the exact bytes it is asked to sign (issue #613).
 *
 * Rev 2 lists seven obligations, and every one of them fails CLOSED, before any
 * signature exists. The payer is signing a transaction a stranger built: the
 * only thing standing between it and a coin spent into someone else's output is
 * that these run first and none of them is skippable.
 *
 * Kept out of the engine so each can be exercised on its own, the way 4C's
 * `receiver/verify.ts` is. Nothing here throws on peer bytes: every refusal is
 * a returned string, and the two signature verifications go through the repo's
 * own wrappers, which already turn a library throw into `false`.
