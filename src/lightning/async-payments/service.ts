/**
 * Async receive service, LSP side (issue #709).
 *
 * The service is the boundary that turns the hold_htlc marker from an
 * instruction anyone can write into a capability this node granted:
 *
 *  - It is DISABLED by default. Off, the node advertises no feature bit,
 *    answers no registration request, and treats the marker as an unknown
 *    odd TLV (the forward proceeds or fails exactly as without it).
 *  - On, it advertises Feature.ASYNC_RECEIVE_SERVICE (odd bit) and answers
 *    ASYNC_REGISTRATION_REQUEST onion messages, SIGNED by the receiver's node
 *    key (the transport peer of an onion message is only the last hop and
 *    is never consulted), with a signed grant (receiver-grant.ts) that binds
 *    the receiver, this LSP, the permitted outgoing channel, every
 *    per-receiver ceiling, the fee schedule and an expiry. The registration
 *    is a durable ledger row under its own prefix (the same DurableLedger
 *    the held-forward ledger uses); a receiver's rows are bounded, the
 *    oldest revoked ones folded into the newest and forgotten.
 *  - Every hold is ADMITTED before it is parked: the marker's registration
 *    id must name an ACTIVE, unexpired registration whose receiver is the
 *    peer on the outgoing channel and whose SCID is the channel the path
 *    forwards onto; then the part, payment, receiver and global limits on
 *    count, value, bytes and CLTV window are judged against the ledger's
 *    current occupancy; then the price. The verdict and the durable hold row
 *    are produced in one synchronous step with no await between them, so two
 *    admissions cannot both pass a check that only one of them fits.
 *
 * Pricing. Two fees, each with one deterministic collection point:
 *
 *  - Admission fee, per part, NON-REFUNDABLE: debited from the receiver's
 *    prepaid credit when the hold row is written. Release, failure, a
 *    disconnect, an expiry at the cutoff: none of them refund it. Credit
 *    spent is derived from the hold rows themselves (every row carries the
 *    fee it was admitted with), so the debit is atomic with the reservation
 *    for free and survives a restart with the row. Credit is accounted PER
 *    RECEIVER across every registration it ever held: the initial credit is
 *    granted once, when a receiver first registers, a renewal carries the
 *    balance forward, and a receiver that re-registers refills nothing.
 *    When the credit cannot cover another part, admission refuses. This is
 *    what prices an abandoned hold: a receiver that lets holds expire pays
 *    the admission fee for each one and, once its credit is gone, can
 *    reserve nothing.
 *  - Holding fee, per block of the reserved window, paid by the SENDER: the
 *    receiver's blinded path adds holdingFeeMsatPerBlock * maxHoldBlocks to
 *    the LSP hop's payment_relay base fee, admission checks the incoming
 *    amount covers it on top of the forwarding policy fee, and the LSP
 *    keeps it at release as the difference between the incoming and
 *    outgoing HTLC, exactly like any forwarding fee. A hold that fails
 *    (expiry, receiver fail, unplaceable release) refunds the sender the
 *    whole HTLC, holding fee included, because the LSP delivered nothing.
 *    The window is priced whole rather than per block actually held: the
 *    capacity is reserved for the whole window at admission, and a sender
 *    cannot price a fee that depends on when the receiver comes back.
