/**
 * Held-forward ledger (issue #708): the durable record of every inbound HTLC
 * an LSP has parked for an offline receiver, with its lifecycle.
 *
 * Identity. Every held incoming HTLC gets a random 32-byte `hold_id` and
 * keeps its canonical (incoming_channel_id, incoming_htlc_id) identity. The
 * payment hash is an INDEX (parts of one payment share it), never a key:
 * two MPP parts, a retry, or a duplicate add each get their own record.
 *
 * Lifecycle, every arrow a compare-and-swap on the durable row:
 *
 *   HELD -> RELEASING -> RELEASED      (capability accepted, forward placed)
 *   HELD -> FAILING   -> FAILED        (cutoff reached, or operator fail)
 *   RELEASING -> FAILING               (release won, but the forward could
 *                                       not be placed before the cutoff)
 *   RELEASING -> FAILED                (the forward was refused outright and
 *                                       the refusal already failed upstream,
 *                                       or owes that failure)
 *   RELEASING -> RELEASED [heldBySplice] (the forward was refused and the
 *                                       JIT engine took the part for a
 *                                       splice; the engine alone forwards
 *                                       or fails it from here, issue #722)
 *
 * The CLTV cutoff. A hold's `cutoffHeight` is fixed when it is parked:
 *
 *   cutoffHeight = min(forwardCltv - DEFAULT_MIN_FINAL_CLTV_EXPIRY,
 *                      incomingCltvExpiry - heldExpiryMargin)
 *
 * The first term is the last height at which the outgoing HTLC still gives
 * the receiver the final-hop headroom it advertises (a beignet receiver
 * refuses anything shorter as expiry-too-soon); the second is the LSP's own
 * margin before its inbound leg would have to be resolved on-chain. A
 * release is accepted only while height < cutoffHeight; at cutoffHeight the
 * per-block scan moves the hold to FAILING. Both are CAS transitions on the
 * same row from HELD, so a release racing the cutoff has exactly one durable
 * winner: whichever write lands first, and the loser sees `stale`.
 *
 * MPP policy. Atomic payment-set release is the default: the receiver, who
 * alone knows the payment's total, signs one capability naming the complete
 * set of hold ids, and `beginRelease` moves the whole set HELD -> RELEASING
 * in one store transaction or not at all. Independent part release is the
 * same call with a set of one, which a receiver uses for amount-less
 * invoices where no total is known. The LSP never guesses a total: it
 * cannot see total_msat inside a blinded final payload.
