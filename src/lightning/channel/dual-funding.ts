/**
 * BOLT 2 v2: Dual-Funding Session.
 *
 * Orchestrates the v2 channel opening flow:
 *   open_channel2 -> accept_channel2 -> interactive TX negotiation
 *   -> tx_signatures -> channel_ready
 *
 * Manages state transitions and uses InteractiveTxBuilder for
 * collaborative transaction construction.
 *
 * Trust model for peer inputs (issue #311): interactive-tx is a BOLT 2
 * property, so every receive-side check of a peer's tx_add_input prev_tx
 * (parse, vout range, segwit-only, the tx_complete solvency audit, witness
 * verification) is self-consistency over bytes the peer chose. A fabricated
 * prevout yields a negotiated funding tx that can never confirm, while our
 * pledged inputs stay reserved. Two mitigations, both best effort:
 *   - When the node has a chain backend, peer prevouts are verified against
 *     the chain as tx_add_input arrives (ChannelManager.verifyPeerFundingInput)
 *     and POSITIVE evidence of a spend (the prevout's tx confirmed on its
 *     script with the output no longer unspent) aborts the negotiation.
 *     Absence from the server's view is NOT conclusive (BOLT 2 permits
 *     unconfirmed inputs and an honest parent may not be indexed yet), so a
 *     fully fabricated prevout classifies 'unknown' and proceeds; the pledge
 *     release below is the mitigation for that case. A fast negotiation can
 *     outrun the verdict. Splice inputs are not covered.
 *   - When a v2 open dies terminally before our tx_signatures were released,
 *     its funding pledges release at once (releaseInputPledges) instead of
 *     waiting out the pledge TTL. Post-signature deaths keep the TTL as the
 *     backstop: the peer may broadcast, so an early release could double
 *     spend a funding tx that still confirms.
 *
 * tx_abort and RBF refusal semantics (issue #309): tx_abort IS the refusal
 * signal for tx_init_rbf. BOLT 2 makes it explicit: the recipient "MUST
 * respond either with tx_abort or with tx_ack_rbf" and "MAY send tx_abort
 * for any reason". The refusal is ATTEMPT-scoped, never open-scoped: only
 * the replacement attempt dies, both sides retain the current attempt, and
 * with a fully signed attempt the channel keeps waiting for confirmation
 * (tx_abort receiver rule: having sent tx_signatures, a node "MUST NOT
 * forget the channel until any inputs to the negotiated tx have been
 * spent"). Verified against both major implementations:
 *   - Eclair 0.14.1 (ChannelOpenDualFunded.scala) rejects tx_init_rbf with
 *     stay() + TxAbort (status RbfAborted, channel alive), and treats an
 *     answering tx_abort to its own request as "our peer rejected our rbf
 *     attempt": it rolls back to WaitingForConfirmations and stays in
 *     WAIT_FOR_DUAL_FUNDING_CONFIRMED on the original funding tx.
 *   - CLN (openingd/dualopend.c) refuses in rbf_remote_start via
 *     open_abort() (sends tx_abort) and frees only the RBF-scoped tx_state,
 *     keeping the previously committed attempt; its handle_tx_abort echoes
 *     and aborts the negotiation without disconnecting.
 * Channel.handleTxInitRbf / handleTxAbort implement the same convergence
 * (the pending-RBF branch consumes an incoming tx_abort as the refusal and
 * resumes the frozen tx_signatures release of the retained attempt).
 *
 * RBF window (issue #360): the spec window is supported in both directions.
 * A funding tx may be replaced from the initial commitment exchange until
 * channel_ready crosses in either direction or an attempt confirms —
 * covering both beignet's legacy pre-signatures window and the BOLT 2
 * window Eclair/CLN use (a completed, broadcast, unconfirmed attempt). The
 * codecs carry the funding_output_contribution and require_confirmed_inputs
 * TLVs. Superseded broadcastable attempts are retained durably
 * (IChannelState.v2PreviousAttempts) and chain-watched beside the current
 * one: each replacement double-spends all of its predecessors (enforced at
 * tx_complete beside the fee-not-lower rule), at most one attempt can
 * confirm, and whichever does is adopted.
 *
 * Either side may change its funding_output_contribution per attempt, so
 * capacity, both balances and both capacity-derived channel reserves are
 * per-attempt too: every record snapshots the amounts its commitment #0 was
 * built at, and every rollback, adoption and restart restores them together
 * with the funding outpoint (an attempt rebuilt at another attempt's amounts
 * would not be covered by the peer's stored signature). An absent TLV means
 * "unchanged" rather than the spec's "not contributing", for compatibility
 * with beignet peers predating the TLV.
 *
 * Neither reserve is negotiated on a v2 channel (issue #379): BOLT 2 fixes it
 * at 1% of the total capacity or the dust_limit_satoshis, whichever is greater,
 * with no maximum, and both peers derive it. See Channel.v2ReserveWeKeep /
 * v2ReserveWeEnforce for which dust limit floors which side and why. A peer's
 * dust_limit_satoshis is bounded here at both receive sites, as v1 has bounded
 * it since the FS-1 audit: unbounded, it both trims our commitment output away
 * and drives the derived reserve past the whole capacity.
 *
 * open_channel2 and accept_channel2 also INHERIT their v1 counterparts'
 * requirements, so both receive sites run BOLT 2's initial-commitment MUST-fails
 * (Channel._v2InitialCommitmentRefusal, shared with the RBF path): the funder
 * must afford commitment #0's fee, and a both-sides-below-reserve split is
 * refused. A third rule, beignet's own, covers what those two cannot on an
 * asymmetric-dust channel: a split is refused when the LARGER post-fee balance
 * falls BELOW the LARGER of the two dust limits, which is exactly when one of
 * the two commitments is built with no outputs and cannot be broadcast at all.
 * Strictly below, because the builder keeps an output whose value lands exactly
 * on the dust limit (issue #388).
 *
 * Our on-chain contribution is sourced through
 * IFundingProvider.selectDualFundingInputs, never selectSpliceInputs (issue
 * #380): a splice-sized selection reserves for a shared 2-of-2 funding input
 * this transaction does not have, which flips from over- to under-reserving
 * past ~8 wallet inputs and aborts the open as underfunded after
 * accept_channel2. Selection and Channel._computeDualFundingContributions both
 * price with dualFundingContributionWeight, so the derived change is exact at
 * every input count. An RBF top-up passes topUp = true and is charged only
 * dualFundingTopUpWeight, since the shortfall the quote returned already covers
 * the fixed terms. Providers predating the method fall back to
 * selectSpliceInputs unchanged.
 *
 * Because selection is exact rather than padded, the derived change routinely
 * lands just above zero, so a change output is emitted only at or above the
 * negotiated interactive-tx dust floor (546 sats or the larger commitment dust
 * limit, whichever is greater) and becomes extra fee below it. The 294-sat
 * P2WPKH figure is NOT the governing limit here: the builder rejects any output
 * under the interactive-tx floor on the way out, and the peer rejects it on the
 * way in, so emitting one kills an otherwise fundable open.
 *
 * Deliberate policy residuals, all spec-legal under
 * MAY-abort-for-any-reason:
 *   - post-restart replacements are refused (the wallet signing closures
 *     die with the process; adoption of persisted candidates still works);
 *   - contribution changes are refused on a leased open (bLIP-51: the
 *     will_fund signature and the lease fee were made over the original
 *     amounts);
 *   - initiation stays opener-only (the spec allows either side; Eclair
 *     and CLN only expose opener-side commands).
