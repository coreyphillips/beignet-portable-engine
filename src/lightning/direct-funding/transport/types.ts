/**
 * Direct-funding transports: the lane contract and the registry seam (issue
 * #611, LFBW port #532 workstream 4B).
 *
 * A lane moves an opaque sealed frame (4A `frames.ts`) between a payer and a
 * receiver. Three of them ship here: a direct peer connection, BOLT onion
 * messages over blinded paths, and a blind relay through the receiver's LSP.
 * A fourth type is reserved for the deferred rendezvous transport (#533).
 *
 * The fork had the lane abstraction and no selection: which lane to use was an
 * if-else chain in one HTTP route, and the swarm lane was a top-level import,
 * so `require('hyperswarm')` ran at boot even with the swarm disabled. A plugin
 * that must be imported before it can be optional is not optional. Hence
 * `DfTransportRegistry`: a lane is registered with a config gate and a LOADER,
 * and a lane that is disabled or never selected is never loaded at all.
 *
 * The lane layer reads no plaintext. It carries `(subtype, sealed bytes)` and
 * knows nothing about offers, transactions or channels; 4C and 4D own those.
