/**
 * The outstanding-request store (rev 2 "Request lifecycle requirements").
 *
 * Every envelope handed out is backed by a record holding secrets the
 * receiver needs to answer it: the receipt preimage, the per-request
 * encryption private key, and the blinded path's private path_id. Without
 * durability, a restart makes every request already in the wild unpayable and
 * loses the preimage that acknowledges a payment.
 *
 * Storage is the ENCRYPTED wallet-data store, not a file beside it. That is a
 * deliberate departure from the fork, which wrote
 * `<dataDir>/direct-funding-requests.json` with a bare writeFileSync: the mode
 * 0600 applies only at creation, so an existing file with looser permissions
 * is never corrected, and the write is not atomic, so a crash mid-write leaves
 * the restore path logging and continuing with nothing restored. Wallet data
 * is encrypted at rest and lands inside the surrounding SQLite transaction.
 * The file path was never a consumer contract; nothing reads it.
