/**
 * Run the two infrastructure-free unit suites at the same time.
 *
 * They are independent processes with no shared fixture, and neither saturates
 * the machine on its own: measured on 8 cores, test:lightning at the mocha
 * default of 7 workers uses 259s of CPU over 57s of wall clock, i.e. roughly
 * half the box, because each worker spends a large share of its time waiting
 * rather than computing. Running them in sequence leaves most of the machine
 * idle for most of the run.
 *
 * Measured on 8 cores (master e1e7118 plus the test:cli --parallel change):
 *
 *   test:lightning alone      55.6s   6211 passing
 *   test:cli alone            50.5s   1359 passing
 *   both, this script         77.1s   7570 passing
 *
 * Against the scripts as they shipped before this change (test:cli serial at
 * 140.0s), the same two suites in sequence were 195.6s.
 *
 * test:chaos is deliberately NOT here, and that is a measured decision rather
 * than an oversight. Its cases carry real wall-clock budgets that do not care
 * how loaded the box is: chaosWait defaults to 15s (helpers/chaos-harness.ts),
 * the quorum barrier to 20s, and helpers/chaos-quorum.ts's waitFor to 10s.
 * Sharing the machine ate one of them. Running all three concurrently failed
 * on the second attempt with
 *
 *   refusal then kill: a barrier timeout freezes, and dying frozen still
 *   resumes exactly:  Error: chaosWait timed out with the victim alive
 *
 * while the same suite passes 30/30 on its own, twice. A flaky gate is worse
 * than a slow one, so chaos keeps the box to itself: run `npm run test:chaos`
 * separately.
 *
 * Worker split. More workers is not better: each mocha worker re-transpiles the
 * src tree independently with no cross-process cache, so raising --jobs buys
 * overlap at about 15s of extra CPU per worker. Measured on the lightning
 * suite, wall clock is flat from 4 to 7 workers and then degrades (jobs 12 =
 * 66s, jobs 16 = 82s). The split below keeps the total near the core count
 * rather than double it: on 8 cores that is 4 workers for lightning and 3
 * for cli.
 *
 * Output is captured per suite rather than interleaved, because two mocha
 * reporters writing to one terminal is unreadable. A failing suite prints its
 * own tail so the failure is actionable without a re-run.

 * Floors raised for #614 (5A), from 6211/1359 measured at 016053c, before 4A
 * through 4D and the direct-funding and splice fixes that followed them. This
 * branch rebased onto 6d48ff4 measures 6666 passing in lightning and 1454 in
 * cli, with nothing pending in either.
 *
 * Lightning's floor is that 6666 less the five tests whose environment decides
 * whether they run: one websocket case needs globalThis.WebSocket (Node 21+,
 * and CI is on 20), two conformance cases need a captured eclair fixture, and
 * the two integration cases need bitcoind and Electrum. All five ran in the
 * measurement (Node 22, the docker stack up), and everything else in the suite
 * runs everywhere, so 6661 is the number a silent elision has to clear.
 * Nothing in the cli glob skips (daemon-security and daemon-integration are
 * excluded from it), so that floor is the measurement itself.
