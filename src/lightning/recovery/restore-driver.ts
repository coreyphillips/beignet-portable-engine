/**
 * The restore driver (docs/RECOVERY-PROTOCOL.md 5.7, Phase 5): turning a
 * seed plus a guardian set back into a running node.
 *
 * The order of operations is the whole point, and it is not negotiable:
 *
 * ```text
 * read heads from all reachable guardians (need `required` responses)
 *       |
 * reconcile the highest quorum-consistent head
 *       |
 * repair laggards: SYNC_RECORD for records, SYNC_EPOCH for takeovers
 *       |
 * ACQUIRE_EPOCH(expectedState): CAS takeover, retried IDEMPOTENTLY
 *       |
 * FENCE IS NOW IN PLACE
 *       |
 * download, verify against the certified head, reconstruct, persist lease
 * ```
 *
 * Fence before restore, never the reverse (5.7). The invariant precisely:
 * NO DOWNLOADED STATE IS INSTALLED OR USED FOR LOCAL RECONSTRUCTION before
 * the takeover fixes the superseded epoch's final head. Records ARE fetched
 * earlier than that, because repairing a lagging guardian means relaying
 * records to it, and without that repair the CAS can never assemble a
 * quorum at all; those records are relayed, never installed. If
 * reconstruction ran first, a still-live old device could certify one more
 * state between this device's fetch and its acquisition, and the restored
 * node would hold a stale head while believing it is current.
 *
 * Every refusal in here is deliberate. Adopting a head lower than a
 * committed one, taking over without a quorum, or treating one guardian's
 * word as proof would each trade a provable state for a plausible one, and
 * this protocol exists precisely to refuse that trade.
 *
 * One guardian's word IS enough for exactly one thing: a root-signed
 * rotation (wire 5.9, 5.11). The set this driver was pointed at may have
 * retired the namespace in favour of another, and the retirement is
 * accepted by as few as one outgoing member. So every head read verifies
 * the rotation evidence it carries before anything is reconciled, and an
 * ERR_SET_RETIRED answer to the takeover re-reads the heads instead of
 * being outvoted. A proven rotation ends the restore with
 * RestoreRotatedError, having written nothing to the outgoing set; the
 * caller follows it to the incoming set. Proceeding instead would acquire
 * an epoch on a retired set and leave its members disagreeing about which
 * generation is live.
