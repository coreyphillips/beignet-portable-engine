/**
 * The transport registry: lane selection, and the seam #533 registers into.
 *
 * This file imports NO lane. Lanes arrive through `register`, each with a
 * config gate and a loader that is called at most once and only when a
 * descriptor of its type is actually selected. That is what makes an optional
 * lane optional: a build without the dependency loads, serves every other lane,
 * and skips the missing one by name.
 *
 * Two rules from rev 2 live here rather than in the caller, because a caller
 * that gets either wrong loses money rather than a connection:
 *
 *  - Only connection-establishment failures fall through to a later
 *    descriptor. Once any frame has been put on a lane, that lane owns the
 *    exchange: re-running it elsewhere would offer the same coin twice.
 *  - A descriptor type nobody claims is SKIPPED, by its length prefix, not
 *    treated as an error. Type 4 is exactly that until #533 lands.
