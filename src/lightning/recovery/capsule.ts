/**
 * Recovery Capsule over BOLT 1 peer_storage (docs/RECOVERY-PROTOCOL.md 5.4,
 * Phase 3).
 *
 * peer_storage carries a CAPSULE, not the journal: BOLT 1 caps the blob at
 * 65531 bytes, stores only the latest one, lets providers rate-limit
 * persistence, and explicitly warns not to expect the latest blob back. The
 * capsule therefore always carries enough for Tier 1 emergency recovery (the
 * encrypted SCB) plus a locator for the real replicated state: the journal
 * tip, the retained base snapshot hash and, from Phase 4, guardian
 * descriptors. For small wallets the complete stored journal often FITS
 * inline, which makes exact Tier 2 restore possible from peer_storage alone
 * with zero new infrastructure; when it does not fit, the capsule degrades
 * gracefully to SCB + locator.
 *
 * Encryption: AES-256-GCM under HKDF(nodeSecret, 'beignet-recovery-capsule-v1')
 * (info string verified non-colliding with 3.6 and the 5.3 journal strings),
 * so a seed-restored node re-derives the key from its identity secret alone.
 * The inner SCB is itself encodeScb output keyed by the SAME node secret, so
 * the capsule is fully self-contained: nothing beyond the seed-derived node
 * key is needed to use either tier. The encrypted blob starts with the
 * 4-byte magic 'bRC1' so restore code can cheaply recognize capsule blobs
 * among retrieved peer-storage blobs, which may be stale, foreign or garbage.
 *
 * Inline Tier 2 state is the journal AS STORED: the AEAD-encrypted frame rows
 * plus the recovery_meta the verifier needs. Restore installs them into an
 * empty database and then runs the exact Phase 2 machinery
 * (loadVerifiedFrames + reconstructFromFrames), so every tamper, reorder,
 * gap, truncation and deleted-base check applies to capsule restores too, and
 * the rebuilt tables are byte-identical by the same property the journal
 * tests prove.
