/**
 * Per-channel recovery status (docs/RECOVERY-PROTOCOL.md 5.6, Phase 5).
 *
 * Richer than a binary exact/stale: after a restore every channel walks
 * through reestablish and lands in exactly one of these, and the two
 * stale-side states carry the protocol's hardest invariant with them: a
 * channel in LocalDataLoss or StateUncertain must NEVER broadcast its
 * stored local commitment, even if the peer stays unreachable forever.
 * Unilateral force close from those states is forbidden; the only safe
 * exits are the peer closing (the DLP path) or an operator explicitly
 * accepting the risk through a clearly-labeled escape hatch that does not
 * exist in this codebase on purpose.
 *
 * String-valued so getRecoveryStatus() reads honestly over the wire and in
 * logs; the variants match the spec's enum member for member.
