	 *    next index is floored at the tip times CHANNEL_INDEX_FLOOR_STRIDE:

	 *    that same window on its own, for embedders that supply no
	 *    predicate; this clause states it on the daemon's side too.
	 * An idle lane on a populated database does NOT refuse. The floor
	 * provides bounded spacing: for unclamped heights H > H0, sequential
	 * allocation from H0 * 128 leaves every consumed index below H * 128
	 * while at most 128 * (H - H0) indices have been consumed. Rejected
	 * opens hand their index back, so only accepted ones count against that
