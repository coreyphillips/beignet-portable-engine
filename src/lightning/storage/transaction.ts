/**
 * Composable storage transactions without nesting.
 *
 * IStorageBackend.transaction promises atomicity for ONE call; it does not
 * promise that transactions nest (the SQLite backend happens to tolerate
 * nesting via better-sqlite3 savepoints, but a conforming backend may
 * reject a BEGIN inside a BEGIN outright). Composed operations, e.g. a
 * capsule install whose reconstruction replays frames through
 * RecoveryManager.commit, therefore must SHARE one transaction rather than
 * open one per unit.
 *
 * This helper tracks, per backend instance, whether a transaction opened
 * through it is already active: the outermost call opens the real backend
 * transaction, and every call made inside it simply joins, so a throw
 * anywhere unwinds to the outermost frame and rolls the whole composition
 * back. Only transactions opened THROUGH this helper are visible to it; a
 * caller that opens a raw backend transaction and then calls into helper
 * users keeps the backend's own (unspecified) nesting behavior.
