/**
 * JIT channel receive, LSP side (LSPS2-inspired; issue #594, LFBW port #532
 * workstream 3A).
 *
 * A wallet with no channel, or with too little inbound, registers a receive
 * intent with its liquidity peer over the beignet custom message type (#546).
 * The LSP mints a synthetic "intercept SCID", the wallet embeds it as a routing
 * hint in its invoice, and an HTLC addressed to that SCID is HELD rather than
 * failed: the LSP funds a zero-conf channel to the wallet (or splices the
 * wallet's existing channel bigger), then forwards the held parts, deducting an
 * agreed opening fee from the delivered amount.
 *
 *   wallet                          LSP

 *     │<══ zero-conf channel open ═══┤
 *     │<──── forwarded HTLC ─────────┤
 *
 * Trust model, LSPS2's: the LSP fronts the funding with its OWN coins, bounded
 * by its own caps, and the wallet never reveals a preimage unless it actually
 * receives the HTLC. A hold that cannot be funded is a FAILED PAYMENT, never a
 * loss: the preimage is not involved at any point.
 *
 * The opening fee is collected one of two ways, chosen at registration
 * (`JitFeeMode`, echoed in the ack so both sides agree):
 *
 *  - SKIM (LSPS2's way): the fee is deducted from the forwarded HTLC, which
 *    therefore arrives SHORT of the onion's amt_to_forward. Only a final node
 *    that implements the allowance settles that (a beignet wallet does; LND
 *    and CLN fail it, BOLT 4 final_incorrect_htlc_amount). The wallet opts in
 *    with `acceptsSkimmedFee`.
 *  - HOP: the wallet puts the quoted terms into its invoice routing hint as
 *    an ordinary routing fee (fee_base_msat = flat, fee_proportional =
 *    ppm), the SENDER pays it on top, and the LSP forwards the full onion
 *    amount, keeping the difference. The final HTLC equals amt_to_forward,
 *    so any node settles it. The LSP checks, before fronting anything, that
 *    the fee actually arrived on the inbound HTLCs; a payer that ignored the
 *    hint's fee gets a plain temporary failure and nothing is funded.
 *
 * Two things the engine owes unconditionally, because a held HTLC is somebody
 * else's money sitting on our inbound channel:
 *
 *  - Every held part is resolved: forwarded, failed, or failed after a
 *    restart. `scanExpiringHolds` REVOKES a part approaching its inbound CLTV
 *    and fails it upstream, and a revoked part can never be forwarded
 *    afterwards, so a funding that completes late cannot pay downstream for an
 *    inbound leg that was already refunded.
 *  - Fronting is bounded. Every funding, open or splice, spends a registered
 *    intent, and each is bounded by what that intent asked for and by the
 *    engine's caps. Accepting an intent widens nothing but our own outbound
 *    zero-conf authorization for that peer (see `setJitClients`); it never
 *    makes us accept an INBOUND zero-conf channel from them.
