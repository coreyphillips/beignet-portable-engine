/**
 * The payer's durable payment records (issue #613).
 *
 * `docs/RECOVERY-PROTOCOL.md` 5.10 requires new transient state to carry one of
 * four dispositions. This is **D1, persist before emit**: the record reaches
 * storage before the witness reaches the lane, in the same ordering discipline
 * as everything else that lets a commitment out. The fork had none of this, so
 * a crash between the witness send and the HTTP response lost every trace of a
 * payment that may already be on chain (defect D7), which is precisely the
 * scenario the never-reject contract exists to prevent.
 *
 * It lives OUTSIDE the recovery journal, the way `jit:*` does. `RecoveryMutation`
 * has no `metadata` variant, and inventing one would put a payer's private
 * bookkeeping under the guardian quorum's barrier: a record that cannot be
 * written must fail the send, not fence the node. Storage is the encrypted
 * wallet-data store, the same place 4A's request records live.
