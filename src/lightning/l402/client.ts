/**
 * L402 client: fetch a paywalled resource, paying the challenge if needed.
 *
 * The flow, per github.com/lightninglabs/L402:
 *
 *   1. request with any credential already held for this scope
 *   2. on 402, parse the WWW-Authenticate challenge
 *   3. check the invoice against the payment hash the macaroon commits to
 *   4. check the price against the caller's cap
 *   5. pay, store the credential, retry once with Authorization
 *
 * Two rules shape everything here, because this is a code path where a REMOTE
 * response header causes an outbound payment:
 *
 *   Fail closed. A challenge whose commitment cannot be checked, or whose
 *   price cannot be bounded, is not paid.
 *
 *   Pay at most once per call. However the server answers the retry, no
 *   second payment happens inside one l402Fetch, so a misbehaving or hostile
 *   server cannot drive a payment loop.
