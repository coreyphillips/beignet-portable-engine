/**
 * The wire-safety proof: the object that lets a restored device RESUME a
 * channel instead of falling back to DLP (docs/RECOVERY-PROTOCOL.md 5.6, 5.8,
 * Phase 6).
 *
 * Phase 5 deliberately left no way to skip StateUncertain. Every restored
 * channel was marked, permanently, because guardian replication was best
 * effort and a compatible `channel_reestablish` proves nothing about
 * exactness: a peer can under-report its counters while holding a newer
 * state. An earlier attempt at an escape hatch, a caller-supplied
 * `wireSafeThroughSequence` scalar, was removed for a reason worth restating:
 * a bare number is bound to nothing, so one mistaken config value could
 * launder a stale restore into a broadcastable one.
 *
 * This is that escape hatch done properly. It is not configuration, it is
 * evidence, and it is derived from the restore itself rather than supplied to
 * it. The argument it encodes:
 *
 *   In quorum mode no IRREVERSIBLE wire message leaves before the journal
 *   frame that authorized it has reached a guardian quorum. Irreversible
 *   means the gated set: revoke_and_ack, commitment_signed,
 *   update_fulfill_htlc, tx_signatures, splice_locked, funding_signed, the
 *   recovery declarations that establish the never-broadcast invariant, and
 *   the two ACTION forms that put a funding output on chain. The gated set is
 *   therefore message types PLUS action forms, and WIRE_SAFETY_POLICY_VERSION
 *   covers both halves.
 *
 *   Funding is in the set for a reason worth stating separately, because it is
 *   the one case where the loss is not about revocation at all. A restore
 *   below the frame that FIRST records a channel comes back not knowing the
 *   channel exists, while a 2-of-2 naming us sits on chain and the peer's
 *   reestablish gets an unknown-channel error.
 *
 *   The premise is narrower than "no wire message" on purpose, and the gap is
 *   what carries the argument rather than weakening it. Everything ungated is
 *   an UNCOMMITTED update (update_add_htlc, update_fail_htlc, update_fee), a
 *   negotiation step that simply restarts (shutdown, closing_signed, the
 *   interactive-tx and splice preamble) or a message the reestablish rules
 *   regenerate (channel_ready, channel_reestablish). BOLT 2 requires the peer
 *   to discard every one of them across a reconnect that did not commit them,
 *   so none can leave the peer holding a commitment we do not, or a
 *   revocation for a commitment the restored chain still believes is current.
 *
 *   So for every message that irrevocably advanced or discarded commitment
 *   state, the frame behind it is at or below the certified head. A restore
 *   installed AT that head therefore holds every such state the peer could
 *   possibly know about, and in particular can hold no commitment the peer
 *   has already seen us revoke. That is exactly the condition for resuming.
 *
 * The premise is checked, not assumed. The head frame's own plaintext has to
 * declare `quorum`, and that declaration lives inside AEAD-authenticated
 * bytes whose hash the guardians certified, so it cannot be edited after the
 * fact by anyone who did not hold the writer key. The sticky rule in the
 * journal supplies the other half: a chain containing a quorum frame can
 * never be followed by an unbarriered one, so a certified head reading
 * `quorum` also rules out unbarriered frames ABOVE it, which are the frames a
 * restore cannot see.
