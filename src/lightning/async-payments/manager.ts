/**
 * Async payments: AsyncPaymentManager.
 *
 * Two roles, wired through onion messages:
 *  - LSP: parks a forward destined for an offline receiver in the durable
 *    held-forward ledger, tells the receiver what is parked (HELD_HTLC_NOTICE)
 *    and releases parts when a valid release capability arrives.
 *  - Receiver: learns what is parked from a notice (or asks with a query),
 *    signs a release capability with its node key and sends it; on a wake
 *    message, emits so the host reconnects to the LSP.
 *
 * The manager owns the ledger's state machine. The node supplies, per hold,
 * a driver that can place the onward add or fail the inbound HTLC; drivers
 * are process memory and are re-armed by the restart redispatch, while the
 * ledger row is the durable truth every driver action is judged against.
 *
 * Authorization (issue #708): a release names hold ids, is signed by the
 * receiver's node key over a domain-separated digest (release-capability.ts),
 * must arrive from the peer it names as receiver, and that peer must be the
 * one the HOLD recorded as the outgoing channel's peer. The payment hash is
 * never an input to authorization.
