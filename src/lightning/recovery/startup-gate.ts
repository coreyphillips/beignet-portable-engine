/**
 * Startup quarantine (docs/RECOVERY-PROTOCOL.md 5.6, Phase 5).
 *
 * The rule this enforces, from the spec's "additional startup rule":
 *
 *   Channels may not leave quarantine, and the node may not even connect to
 *   channel peers, until current writer ownership is confirmed with the
 *   quorum (or the operator explicitly runs in a mode without guardians).
 *
 * A stale device therefore learns it was superseded BEFORE it can touch the
 * Lightning protocol. That ordering is the whole value: fencing at the
 * replication layer only helps a device that gets as far as writing, while
 * a restarted stale device would otherwise reconnect, exchange
 * channel_reestablish, and act on state it no longer owns.
 *
 * The gate is deliberately conservative in every uncertain case. Confirmed
 * is the ONLY state that permits peer traffic; a proven newer epoch freezes
 * permanently; and no quorum, a conflict, or evidence that only stale
 * guardians could supply all leave the node quarantined, which is safe
 * because a quarantined node simply does nothing.
