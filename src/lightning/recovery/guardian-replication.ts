/**
 * Node-side guardian wiring (docs/RECOVERY-PROTOCOL.md 5.5 and 5.6,
 * Phase 5): establishing the namespace, and replicating journal frames to
 * the guardian set as signed records.
 *
 * Two jobs, deliberately separated:
 *
 * - Establishing ownership. A node with guardians configured may NEVER
 *   conclude "register fresh" from local state: a lost genesis lease and a
 *   node that never enabled guardians are indistinguishable on disk (see
 *   WriterLeaseLoad). So the decision is made by ASKING the set: only a
 *   read quorum reporting the namespace unknown authorizes REGISTER_NODE.
 *   A namespace that already exists means restore or takeover, which is
 *   the restore driver's job, and no quorum means stay quarantined.
 * - Replicating records. Journal frames are already the ciphertext the
 *   guardian stores (wire 3.2), so replication signs the RECORD transcript
 *   over the frame's own position and hashes and fans the record out. This
 *   is BEST EFFORT by design: Phase 5 replicates, Phase 6 adds the quorum
 *   barriers that make an irreversible transition wait for its receipts.
 *   Replication failure here therefore degrades durability, never
 *   correctness, and never blocks a channel.
