/**
 * RecoveryJournal: the append-only, node-wide, hash-chained journal of every
 * safety-critical transition (docs/RECOVERY-PROTOCOL.md 5.3, Phase 2).
 *
 * Frames are appended INSIDE the storage transaction of the transition they
 * record, via RecoveryManager.commit: a transition and its frame are one
 * atomic unit, and a journal failure rolls the transition back. The chain is
 * SHA-256 over each frame's plaintext, linked through previousFrameHash; the
 * payload is AEAD-encrypted (AES-256-GCM) with a per-epoch key whose
 * associated data binds (nodeId, writerEpoch, sequence, previousFrameHash),
 * so a frame cannot be transplanted across epochs or positions.
 *
 * Honest scoping of the hash chain, per the spec: it detects tampering and
 * reordering relative to a known tip. It does NOT by itself prevent rollback;
 * a stale replica can serve a truncated but internally valid chain.
 * Anti-rollback comes from the externally anchored head (guardian receipts,
 * Phase 4+). Until then, the tip in recovery_meta gives the local process
 * truncation detection and channel_reestablish remains the safety net.
 *
 * Snapshots and compaction: every snapshotIntervalFrames deltas the journal
 * emits a full-state snapshot frame (all safety-critical tables, spec 5.3)
 * and prunes the deltas below it. Reconstruction is snapshot + later deltas,
 * replayed through the SAME RecoveryManager code path that produced the
 * originals, which is what makes the rebuilt tables byte-identical.
