/**
 * The channel reserve of a v2 (dual-funded) channel, which BOLT 2 leaves out of

 * the total channel balance ... rounded down to the nearest whole satoshi or the
 * `dust_limit_satoshis`, whichever is greater." Both peers DERIVE it, so there is
 * nothing to negotiate and, crucially, no maximum: the v1 helper's 20% cap can
 * pull the result BELOW the dust limit on a small channel, which is exactly the
 * case the spec's dust floor exists to prevent (a reserve under dust admits a
 * commitment whose outputs all trim away, leaving no spendable exit).
 *
 * The spec does not say WHOSE dust_limit_satoshis floors it, and the two
 * reference implementations disagree: eclair (Commitments.scala localChannelReserve
 * / remoteChannelReserve) floors each side at the OTHER peer's dust limit, while
 * CLN (openingd/dualopend.c set_reserve) gives both sides one value floored at the
 * OPENER's. So the two sides are derived directionally instead of mirroring either,
 * which is safe against both peers at any dust pairing (and identical to both
 * whenever the two dust limits agree, which is every real pairing):
 *
 *   - the reserve WE keep takes the maximum, so it is never below either peer's
 *     dust limit and never below what a conforming peer requires of us. Being
 *     generous here only costs us spendable balance; the reserve is not on the
 *     wire and the commitment builder never reads it, so it cannot change
 *     commitment bytes. This is also the only variant that keeps our reserve
 *     output non-dust in BOTH commitments (BOLT 2's rationale for the v1 dust
 *     couplings is that each reserve sits above both dust limits).
 *   - the reserve we ENFORCE on the peer takes the minimum dust limit and skips
 *     beignet's stricter 546-sat policy floor, so it can never exceed what eclair
 *     (max(1%, our dust)) or CLN (max(1%, opener dust)) computes for itself in
 *     either role. A local policy applied here would reject an honest peer's
 *     spec-legal HTLC.
 *
 * Under-enforcing is inert as far as the peer's own gate is concerned, but NOT
 * as far as our own commitment is concerned: once the two dust limits differ,
 * this value sits below the limit OUR commitment trims at, so a peer balance
 * that clears it can still be dust to us. Channel._localCommitmentEmptyRefusal
 * is what keeps that from emptying the commitment we hold (issue #386).

/**
 * The reserve we may enforce on the peer at a given capacity, re-derived from a

 *
 * The two callers (splice adoption and the load-time repair) both revisit the
 * enforced reserve of a channel that is already open, where the value we
 * advertised is either gone (a row written before issue #381 recorded it) or no
 * longer priced at the current capacity (a splice). Neither may land ABOVE what
 * the peer keeps for itself: over-enforcement refuses an HTLC the peer believes
 * is legal, the refusal is a bare ERROR action the peer never sees, and its next
 * commitment_signed then covers an HTLC we do not hold. Erring low is inert,
 * since the peer's own gate binds and no commitment builder reads this value.
 *
 * Which of the two rules the peer is applying is decided by the row, not by a
 * guess:
 *
 * - DERIVED, for a v2 row or any row that has ever been spliced. A v2 reserve
 *   was never negotiated, so both sides derive it. And eclair switches a channel
 *   to the derived rule for `DualFunding || fundingTxIndex > 0`
 *   (Commitments.scala localChannelReserve), i.e. once it has been spliced, v1
 *   included, keeping max(1% of capacity, a dust limit).
 *   v2ReserveWeEnforce is at or below that in either role and at either peer's
 *   dust pairing, which is exactly why it omits beignet's 546-sat policy floor:
 *   that floor sits above what a spliced peer keeps on a small capacity.
 *   spliceFundingTxid is the marker because it is persisted, starts null and is
 *   only ever assigned; fundingTxIndex is NOT a splice counter (adoption resets
 *   it to 0).
 * - NEGOTIATED, for an unspliced v1 row: the peer keeps the constant we
 *   advertised at open, which is computeChannelReserve at this capacity.
 *
 * The unspliced v1 branch deliberately omits the acceptor's peer-dust floor,
 * which is why it reproduces the OPENER's advertisement exactly and an
 * ACCEPTOR's only from below. That floor arrived in PR #115 and our own dust
 * floor in #381, while computeChannelReserve itself has not changed since the
 * first commit, so a row written before either advertised the unfloored value
 * and nothing on disk tells the two apart. Re-deriving today's floors would put
 * those rows above what their peer keeps, which is the failure this exists to
 * prevent; omitting them can only under-enforce. The unfloored result is still a
 * sound lower bound in both roles, since an acceptor's advertisement is a max
 * over it and an opener's open is refused outright when it lands under our own
 * dust limit (validateOpenChannelParams).
 *
 * A backup-recovered row hardcodes fundingVersion 1 even for a v2 channel, so it
 * takes the negotiated branch; that errs low, and such a row is ERRORED with
 * dataLossDetected and never admits an HTLC anyway.

	 *    (the message arrived for a channel that has since moved to
	 *    SHUTTING_DOWN, CLOSING, SPLICING or ERRORED) and the SENT_STFU half of
	 *    the quiescence guard. There the peer may be entirely conformant and
	 *    simply not yet have seen the transition we made.

	 * channel: localConfig is persisted per channel and nothing re-derives it.
	 * Under 1,000,000 sat that refuses HTLCs the peer is entitled to send, and the
	 * refusal is a bare ERROR the peer never sees, so its next commitment_signed
	 * covers an HTLC we do not hold and the channel force closes. The fix at the
	 * open sites cannot reach a channel that is already open, so without this the
	 * change repairs nothing that exists. A v2 row written before #383 derived
	 * either reserve is the same shape (issue #387).
	 *
	 * It runs ONLY on a row with no channelReserveVersion, i.e. one whose reserve
	 * no site ever wrote. Every site that establishes the value stamps the
	 * version, so a channel that negotiated its reserve keeps that exact number
	 * across restarts and this never sees it. The re-derivation is deliberately
	 * the weakest reserve any build could have advertised at the row's capacity,
	 * which is the right answer for an unmarked row and the wrong one for a
	 * marked row, so the marker is what separates them rather than arithmetic.
	 *
	 * Two further properties make it safe rather than a second guess at what the
	 * channel negotiated:
	 *
	 * - It only ever LOWERS. The enforced reserve is read at three places
	 *   (handleUpdateAddHtlc, handleUpdateFee, and IChannelInfo reporting) and a
	 *   smaller value is strictly more permissive at all of them, so this can stop
	 *   us refusing traffic the peer believes is legal and can never start
	 *   refusing anything. That asymmetry is also why a legacy row above
	 *   1,000,000 sat, which under-enforces, is left alone rather than raised: if
	 *   the re-derivation were wrong for even one row, raising it opens a refusal
	 *   band and force closes that channel.
	 * - reserveWeEnforceAt reads only fields this method never writes, so
	 *   `stored := min(stored, derived)` is a fixed point after one application
	 *   and needs no marker to run once. That matters, because a channel row has
	 *   no schema version to hang a marker on, and the previous gate, "the value
	 *   is still the node's configured one", silently skipped every row whose
	 *   operator had changed that configuration since the channel opened.
	 *   Composing with a splice is safe for the same reason: the adoption tail
	 *   takes the same min against the same function of the same capacity.
	 *
	 * A v2 open still negotiating is left to _restoreV2RecordSnapshot, which
	 * restoreChannel runs immediately before this and which owns both reserves
	 * for the active attempt. Nothing is lost by waiting: such a row is not yet
	 * NORMAL, so it admits no HTLC to over-enforce against, and the repair lands
	 * at the next load once channel_ready nulls the record.

	 * node's configured constant instead. Above 1,000,000 sat that constant is
	 * BELOW what the peer derives, and the first HTLC that crosses into the gap
	 * is one the peer MUST refuse, which fails the channel.
	 *
	 * So this only ever RAISES, exactly as its neighbour only ever lowers. Both

	 * and so does under-keeping for ourselves. Keeping more than we must costs
	 * getSpendableOutboundMsat and nothing else, and it is also why a stored

	 * one visible cost is that as the opener of a small legacy row our own
	 * updateFee can now self-refuse against the larger reserve.
	 *
	 * v2 rows and SPLICED rows, the same branch rule as reserveWeEnforceAt. An
	 * unspliced v1 reserve was negotiated on the wire and stored verbatim, so
	 * there is nothing to re-derive and no ambiguity to resolve. A spliced row
	 * of either version is different (issue #382): eclair re-derives both
	 * reserves from the new capacity once fundingTxIndex > 0, v1 included, so
	 * after a splice-in the peer may be enforcing more against us than the row
	 * kept. The splice adoption tail now raises the kept reserve at every
	 * adoption; this covers rows whose splice adopted BEFORE that existed. And
	 * v2ReserveWeKeep is at or above what eclair (max(1%, a dust limit)) and
	 * CLN (max(1%, the opener's dust limit)) each require of us at any dust
	 * pairing and any splice history (CLN never re-prices across a splice, so
	 * what it enforces is bounded by the max() this composes with), so raising
	 * to it can never overshoot a conforming peer.
	 *
	 * Not gated on channelReserveVersion: that stamp records the provenance of
	 * the reserve we ENFORCE, negotiated versus never written, which says
	 * nothing about a value both peers derive. It needs no marker anyway, since
	 * v2ReserveWeKeep reads only fields this never writes, so
	 * `stored := max(stored, derived)` is a fixed point after one application. A
	 * still-negotiating row is left to _restoreV2RecordSnapshot, which owns both

	 * be a far worse failure than the one this prevents.
	 *

	 * shape of all) is left alone, because dropping it would not stop the peer
	 * publishing, it would only discard what _computeV2ConfirmedAdoption needs
	 * to adopt the channel afterwards and retire our own rebroadcast obligation.
	 *
	 * Disposal is a ROLLBACK wherever there is something to roll back to. An

	 * rebroadcast: retryPendingFundingBroadcasts retires any pending transaction
	 * whose channel is in a dead state. The caller is expected to persist the

	 * limits (v2ReserveWeEnforce, and computeChannelReserve's capacity/5 cap can
	 * land under our own dust limit too), so on an asymmetric-dust channel a
	 * peer balance that clears its reserve can still be dust in OUR commitment.
	 * Pair that with our own balance already under our dust limit, which a v2
	 * open legitimately starts at whenever we contribute little or nothing, and
	 * an ordinary update_add_htlc or update_fee produces a commitment with every
	 * output trimmed. Nothing downstream catches it: the peer builds the same
	 * bytes, so its signature verifies, and prepareForceClose would hand back a
	 * transaction with no outputs, which cannot be broadcast. We would hold no
	 * unilateral exit at all while the peer keeps one. This is the same rule
	 * _v2InitialCommitmentRefusal applies at open, moved to where balances
	 * actually change.
	 *
	 * The cheap gate first: when the reserve we enforce is at or above our own
	 * dust limit, the peer's balance can never fall below it, so their to_remote
	 * output in our commitment always survives and there is nothing to check.
	 * Both handlers admit only when the peer keeps reserve + the commitment fee,
	 * the builder's remote balance is never lower than the live one (it only
	 * takes credits), and with no untrimmed HTLC the builder's fee is at or
	 * below the estimate the handlers use. Every default-configured node sits on
	 * that side of the gate, so the hot path is untouched.
	 *
	 * Past the gate it asks the REAL builder rather than repeating its
	 * arithmetic. buildLocalCommitment also applies the deferred balance credits
	 * of an in-flight settlement round, the second-level fee in the HTLC trim
	 * threshold, the funder's anchor cost and the saturate-at-zero rule; a guard
	 * that re-derived any of those would understate to_local mid-round and
	 * refuse a commitment the builder builds with outputs, which is a force
	 * close of a healthy channel.
	 *
	 * While a fully signed splice awaits its lock, the same question is asked
	 * of the SPLICED view: _splicedState(candidate) re-anchors the candidate
	 * on the new funding, deriving the peer's balance as the remainder of the
	 * new capacity after in-flight HTLC value, so the add's amount counts once
	 * rather than twice. The spliced half runs regardless of the cheap gate:
	 * the reserve we enforce bounds only the peer's LIVE balance, and a peer
	 * splice-out leaves a spliced remainder below it because reserves are not
	 * re-derived until the lock (issue #382). It is skipped when the in-memory
	 * session is not rebuilt (no spliced view exists to check);
	 * _handleCommitmentSignedBatch independently fails closed there before any
	 * revocation. getSpendableOutboundMsat still covers our own sends across

	 *   same batch, so anything reading channel state afterwards, including
	 *   the node's own watch:funding handler, may already see the post-splice
	 *   values.
	 * - The batch's PERSIST_STATE therefore carries this record, which puts it
	 *   on disk before the transaction that supersedes the outpoint is
	 *   authorized to reach the network. A crash in between leaves the record,
	 *   not a gap.
	 *
	 * The script is stored rather than recomputed because a splice may rotate
	 * the peer's funding pubkey, so the channel's later funding script can
	 * hash to something this output never paid.
	 *
	 * RETURNS the action that arms the watch, rather than leaving arming to
	 * whatever the caller remembers to push next to it. Three of the four call
	 * sites got arming for free from a WATCH_FUNDING they happened to emit
	 * anyway; the fourth is the EARLIEST point of no return, it emits no
	 * WATCH_FUNDING because the splice transaction has not been broadcast, and
