/**
 * Swap ledger (issue #737, phase 2): the durable record of every swap a
 * provider has quoted, funded, paid, claimed or refunded, with its lifecycle
 * as compare-and-swap transitions on a DurableLedger row.
 *
 * Identity. A swap id is derived from the requesting peer and the payment
 * hash (keys.ts); the hash is an index, never the key.
 *
 * Reverse swap lifecycle (client pays Lightning, provider funds the chain):
 *
 *   CREATED -> HELD -> FUNDING -> FUNDING_BROADCAST -> FUNDED -> CLAIMED -> SETTLED
 *   FUNDED -> REFUND_PENDING -> REFUNDED          (nobody claimed; hold cancelled
 *                                                  only after REFUNDED)
 *   FUNDING_BROADCAST | REFUND_PENDING -> CLAIMED  (a claim at any depth wins)
 *   CREATED | HELD -> CANCELLED                    (nothing left the wallet)
 *   FUNDING -> FAILED                              (no transaction could be built,
 *                                                  or the hold went before any
 *                                                  bytes were signed)
 *   FUNDING | FUNDING_BROADCAST | FUNDED | REFUND_PENDING | CLAIMED -> EXPOSED
 *                                                  (the Lightning side was cancelled
 *                                                  under us; funds are, or may
 *                                                  be, on chain: signed bytes
 *                                                  whose broadcast threw count)
 *
 * Submarine swap lifecycle (client funds the chain, provider pays Lightning,
 * issue #743):
 *
 *   CREATED -> FUNDING_SEEN -> FUNDED -> PAYING -> PREIMAGE_KNOWN
 *           -> CLAIM_BROADCAST -> CLAIM_CONFIRMED
 *   PAYING -> PAYMENT_UNRESOLVED -> PREIMAGE_KNOWN | PAYMENT_FAILED
 *   PAYING -> PAYMENT_FAILED
 *   PAYMENT_FAILED -> PREIMAGE_KNOWN            (a late success is a success:
 *                                                  the preimage rides the move)
 *   FUNDING_SEEN | FUNDED -> FUNDING_LOST -> FUNDING_SEEN
 *   CREATED | FUNDING_SEEN | FUNDED | FUNDING_LOST -> CANCELLED
 *                                                  (nothing was paid)
 *   CREATED | FUNDING_SEEN | FUNDED -> FAILED       (the invoice expired or the
 *                                                  ceiling no longer fits
 *                                                  before anything was paid)
 *   PAYING | PAYMENT_UNRESOLVED | PREIMAGE_KNOWN | CLAIM_BROADCAST -> EXPOSED
 *                                                  (a payment is out while the
 *                                                  contract is not claimable:
 *                                                  the funding vanished or a
 *                                                  foreign spend confirmed)
 *   EXPOSED -> CLAIM_BROADCAST | PAYMENT_FAILED    (the funding came back, or
 *                                                  every HTLC failed and
 *                                                  nothing was lost)
 *
 * Rules inherited from the held-forward ledger: durable write before memory,
 * every arrow a CAS, rehydrate before serve. Two rules of this ledger's own:
 * a preimage, once recorded, is never removed by any transition, and no
 * private key is ever stored (keys.ts re-derives them).
