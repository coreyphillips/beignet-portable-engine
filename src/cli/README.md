# Beignet CLI & BeignetNode API

A simplified interface for the beignet Bitcoin + Lightning library. Two ways to use it:

1. **`BeignetNode` class** -- import into TypeScript/JS scripts
2. **`beignet` CLI** -- run shell commands that talk to an HTTP daemon

Both return plain JSON with hex string IDs and satoshi amounts (no Buffer, no bigint).

---

## Quick Start

### CLI

```bash
# Initialize (generates mnemonic, writes ~/.beignet/config.json)
npx ts-node src/cli/cli.ts init --network regtest

# Start the daemon (stays in foreground, listens on 127.0.0.1:2112)
npx ts-node src/cli/cli.ts start

# In another terminal:
npx ts-node src/cli/cli.ts info
npx ts-node src/cli/cli.ts balance
npx ts-node src/cli/cli.ts address
npx ts-node src/cli/cli.ts invoice create 1000 "coffee"
npx ts-node src/cli/cli.ts stop
```

After `npm run build`, you can also use the compiled version:

```bash
node dist/cli/cli.js start --network regtest
# or if installed globally via npm link:
beignet start --network regtest
```

### Programmatic (TypeScript)

```typescript
import { BeignetNode } from 'beignet/cli';

const node = await BeignetNode.create({
  network: 'regtest',
  electrumHost: '127.0.0.1',
  electrumPort: 60001,
});

console.log(node.getInfo());
// { nodeId: "02ab...", network: "regtest", onchainBalanceSats: 0, ... }

const addr = await node.getNewAddress();
// "bcrt1q..."

const invoice = node.createInvoice(1000, "test payment");
// { bolt11: "lnbcrt10n1...", paymentHash: "ab12...", amountSats: 1000 }

await node.destroy();
```

---

## BeignetNode API

### Factory

```typescript
const node = await BeignetNode.create({
  mnemonic?: string,        // BIP39 mnemonic; generates new if omitted
  network?: string,         // 'mainnet' | 'testnet' | 'signet' | 'regtest' (default: 'mainnet')
  alias?: string,           // node alias
  dataDir?: string,         // SQLite + data dir (default: ~/.beignet/data)
  electrumHost?: string,    // Electrum server host
  electrumPort?: number,    // Electrum server port
  electrumTls?: boolean,    // use TLS for Electrum
  listenPort?: number,      // listen for inbound Lightning connections
  preferAnchors?: boolean,  // anchor channels (default: true); set false for legacy static_remotekey
  autoBootstrap?: boolean,  // auto-connect to DNS seed peers on start
  autoReconnect?: boolean,  // auto-reconnect to peers on disconnect (default: true)
  electrumServers?: Array<{ host: string; port: number; tls?: boolean }>,  // failover servers
  backupPath?: string,      // enable automated backups to this path
  backupIntervalMs?: number, // backup interval (default: 6 hours, requires backupPath)
  storageEncryption?: boolean, // encrypt SQLite storage at rest with a seed-derived key (default: true)
  dailySpendLimitSats?: number, // COMBINED LN + on-chain daily spending limit in satoshis (resets at midnight UTC; the day's ledger is persisted and survives a restart); see Spending Limits
  connectTimeoutMs?: number,  // timeout for connectPeer() in ms (default: 15000)
  onError?: (error) => void, // error callback for node:error events
  logLevel?: LogLevel,       // 'debug' | 'info' | 'warn' | 'error' | 'silent' (default: 'info')
  logger?: ILogger,          // leveled diagnostic logger; entries passing logLevel are forwarded to it and it is injected into the underlying Wallet + LightningNode
});
```

Internally wires together: `Wallet` + `LightningNode` + `SqliteStorage` + `WalletFundingProvider` + `ElectrumBackend`.

| `openChannelV2(pubkey, params)` | `ChannelInfo` | Open dual-funded v2 channel |
| `closeChannel(channelId, acceptStaleStateRisk?)` | `Promise<{ ok, error? }>` | Cooperative close (`await` it): the payout resolves to a wallet-scanned address first. A capsule-restored channel needs `acceptStaleStateRisk: true`, because a mutual close signs the balances that row carries |
| `forceCloseChannel(channelId, acceptStaleStateRisk?)` | `{ ok, error?, commitmentTxid? }` | Force close; a capsule-restored channel needs `acceptStaleStateRisk: true` |
| `spliceIn(channelId, amountSats, feerate)` | `SpliceResult` | Add funds to existing channel |

#### Invoices

| Method | Returns | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `createInvoice(amountSats?, description?, expirySecs?, descriptionHash?)` | `InvoiceInfo` | Create BOLT 11 invoice. Use `descriptionHash` (hex Buffer) for hashed descriptions > 639 bytes — omit `description` when using hash. Returns `paymentSecret` for correlating incoming payments. |
| `decodeInvoice(bolt11)` | `DecodedInvoice` | Decode any BOLT 11 invoice |
| `listInvoices()` | `InvoiceInfo[]` | List all created invoices |
| `createHoldInvoice({ paymentHash, amountMsat?, amountSats?, description?, expiry?, minFinalCltvExpiry? })` | `InvoiceInfo` | Hold invoice for a caller-supplied `sha256(preimage)`: the preimage stays with the caller and the incoming HTLC parks instead of settling. `minFinalCltvExpiry` is 1..2016 blocks and sets the BOLT 11 `c` tag |
| `settleHoldInvoice(preimage)` | `{ paymentHash }` | Validate `sha256(preimage)` and fulfill every parked HTLC (all MPP parts) |
| `cancelHoldInvoice(paymentHash)` | `{ paymentHash, htlcsFailed }` | Fail parked HTLCs back (`incorrect_or_unknown_payment_details`) and close the invoice |
| `listHoldInvoices()` | `HoldInvoiceInfo[]` | Hold invoices with state `OPEN\|ACCEPTED\|SETTLED\|CANCELLED` and parked totals |

##### Hold invoices

A hold (HODL) invoice decouples HTLC acceptance from settlement. The caller
generates a preimage, keeps it, and hands `sha256(preimage)` to
`createHoldInvoice`. When the payer pays, the HTLC is validated and **parked**:
the payer sees the payment as in-flight (PENDING) while the recipient decides.
`settleHoldInvoice(preimage)` completes it (the payer receives the preimage);
`cancelHoldInvoice(paymentHash)` fails it back as if the invoice were unknown.
Parked HTLCs are restart-safe (they re-park from storage) and are
**auto-cancelled** by the CLTV sweeper 18 blocks before the HTLC expiry, so a
forgotten hold can never force an on-chain timeout. Typical uses: escrow-style
flows, just-in-time inventory checks, atomic swaps (the reverse swap provider
below mints them; the submarine provider pays a peer's ordinary invoice).

Hold progress fires events (`hold:accepted`, `hold:settled`, `hold:cancelled`),
relayed over SSE and webhooks. `hold:accepted` fires for each new parked part,
including partial MPP payments. Before funding a swap, compare
`BigInt(heldAmountMsat)` with the full expected amount in millisatoshis.
The `ACCEPTED` state alone does not mean the invoice is fully funded. The
final hop enforces the invoice's `minFinalCltvExpiry` on every arriving HTLC,
and each event and `GET /invoices/held` row reports the realised
`earliestExpiry` and `cancelHeight` of the parked set, so a swap provider can
verify the Lightning leg outlives its on-chain refund before funding.

#### Payments

| Method | Returns | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `payInvoice(bolt11, timeoutMs?, maxFeeSats?, amountSats?, metadata?, cltvLimit?)` | `Promise<PaymentInfo>` | Pay invoice. **Blocks until settled or timeout** (default 60s). At the timeout the payment is failed only when no HTLC is out for it; with one still in flight the record stays `PENDING` until that HTLC resolves, no further route is tried after the timeout, and the record is failed when the HTLC fails or its on-chain timeout resolves; the `PAYMENT_TIMEOUT` message says so (issue #976). `maxFeeSats` caps routing fees. `amountSats` is required for amount-less invoices. `metadata` attaches key-value labels. `cltvLimit` caps the payment's total CLTV expiry at that many blocks above the current tip (every attempt, retry and MPP part); when no route fits it fails with `CLTV_EXCEEDS_MAX` and nothing is sent. A swap provider paying the counterparty's invoice sets it from the on-chain refund height (#751). |
| `payInvoiceSafe(bolt11, timeoutMs?, maxFeeSats?, amountSats?, metadata?, cltvLimit?)` | `Promise<PaymentInfo>` | Like `payInvoice` but **never throws**: catches all errors and resolves with the hash's existing record when there is one (after a timeout with an HTLC still out, the `PENDING` record, which no further route is tried for and which is failed when that HTLC fails or its on-chain timeout resolves; for a duplicate refusal, the record the engine refused from) and otherwise with `status: 'FAILED'`. The `failureDescription` field contains `[ERROR_CODE] message` for machine parsing. |
| `sendPaymentAsync(bolt11, maxFeeSats?, amountSats?, metadata?, cltvLimit?)` | `{ paymentHash, status: 'PENDING' \| 'FAILED' }` | Fire-and-forget pay. Returns immediately, `FAILED` when the engine refused the submission outright (an expired invoice, an HTLC the channel would not take). Poll `getPayment()` for settlement. Drain mode and the spending limits are applied at submission, so it can throw `SERVICE_DRAINING` or `SPENDING_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`; the limits use the invoice's own amount whenever it carries one, since that is what gets paid. |
| `payInvoiceWithRetry(bolt11, opts?)` | `Promise<RetryPaymentResult>` | Pay with exponential backoff retry. `opts: { maxRetries? (3), backoffMs? (2000), maxFeeSats?, amountSats?, metadata?, cltvLimit? }`. Emits `payment:retry` events. |
| `cancelPayment(paymentHash)` | `{ ok: true }` | Cancel a pending outbound payment (marks as FAILED). The HTLC cannot be retracted, so a cancelled payment keeps holding its amount against the daily limit until that HTLC settles or fails back, or the 24h window ends; `getDailySpendInfo().pendingSats` shows what is held. |
| `listPayments(filter?)` | `PaymentInfo[]` | List payments sorted by createdAt desc. Filter by `status`, `direction`, `since`, `limit`, `offset`, `metadataKey`, `metadataValue`. |
| `getPayment(paymentHash)` | `PaymentInfo \| null` | Get specific payment |
| `setPaymentMetadata(paymentHash, metadata)` | `void` | Attach key-value metadata to an existing payment |
| `sendKeysend(pubkey, amountSats, timeoutMs?, maxFeeSats?, metadata?)` | `Promise<PaymentInfo>` | Spontaneous payment (no invoice). **Blocks until settled or timeout** (default 60s), with the same timeout rule as `payInvoice`. |
| `sendKeysendSafe(pubkey, amountSats, timeoutMs?, maxFeeSats?, metadata?)` | `Promise<PaymentInfo>` | Like `sendKeysend` but **never throws** — resolves with `status: 'FAILED'` instead. |

#### BOLT 12 Offers

| Method | Returns | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `createOffer({ description, amountSats?, issuer? })` | `OfferInfo` | Create a reusable BOLT 12 offer |
| `decodeOfferString(offerStr)` | `OfferInfo` | Decode a BOLT 12 offer string without paying |
| `listOffers()` | `OfferInfo[]` | List local offers |
| `payOffer(offerStr, amountSats?, timeoutMs?)` | `Promise<PaymentInfo>` | Pay a BOLT 12 offer (requests invoice, then pays). **Blocks until settled or timeout** (default 60s), with the same timeout rule as `payInvoice`. Drain mode and the spending limits apply to the returned invoice's amount |

#### Channel Readiness

| Method | Returns | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `getReadyChannels()` | `ChannelInfo[]` | List channels that are NORMAL and will accept a new HTLC |
| `canSend(amountSats)` | `{ canSend, bestChannelId?, availableSats }` | Check if you can send this amount (accounts for channel reserves) |
| `canReceive(amountSats)` | `{ canReceive, bestChannelId?, availableSats }` | Check if you can receive this amount (accounts for channel reserves) |

#### Route Estimation & Probing

| Method | Returns | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `estimateRouteFee(bolt11, amountSats?)` | `RouteEstimate \| null` | Estimate fee without sending. Returns `{ feeSats, hops, cltvDelta }` or null |
| `probeRoute(destination, amountSats)` | `{ success, feeSats?, hops? }` | Probe route viability to a destination node |
| `estimatePayment(bolt11, amountSats?)` | `PaymentEstimate \| null` | Full payment intelligence: success probability, route quality, estimated fee and time, warnings |

#### Graph Queries

| Method | Returns | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `getGraphInfo()` | `GraphInfo` | Node/channel counts + last gossip sync time this session |
| `getGraphNode(pubkey)` | `GraphNodeInfo \| null` | Node announcement info (alias, addresses, features) + its known channel SCIDs |
| `getGraphChannel(scid)` | `GraphChannelInfo \| null` | Channel endpoints, capacity (from htlc_maximum_msat) and both directions' policies |
| `describeGraph(limit?, offset?)` | `GraphDescribeResult` | Paged channel dump (limit defaults to 500, capped at 500) |
| `queryRoute(destination, amountSats, maxFeeSats?)` | `RouteQueryResult` | Compute a route WITHOUT sending; hops feed `sendToRoute` |
| `sendToRoute(paymentHash, route, paymentSecret?)` | `PaymentInfo` | Send a payment along an explicit route from `queryRoute` |

#### Payment Proof

| Method | Returns | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `getPaymentProof(paymentHash)` | `PaymentProof \| null` | Cryptographic proof of a completed payment (preimage, invoice, route info) |
| `verifyPaymentProof(paymentHash)` | `PaymentProofVerification` | Verify proof cryptographically: `sha256(preimage) === paymentHash`. Returns `{ valid, proof?, error? }` |

#### Payment Queue

| Method | Returns | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `enqueuePayment(bolt11, priority?, opts?)` | `QueuedPayment` | Add payment to priority queue (1-10, lower = higher priority). `opts: { amountSats?, maxFeeSats?, metadata? }` |
| `listQueue()` | `QueuedPayment[]` | List all queue entries |
| `cancelQueuedPayment(id)` | `boolean` | Cancel a queued payment by ID |
| `resolveInterruptedPayment(bolt11)` | `Promise<InterruptedPaymentOutcome>` | How a payment the queue was dispatching ended (one a restart interrupted, or one still out at the queue's payment timeout), from the node's record (in memory, then on disk): `{ status: 'completed', paymentHash }` or `{ status: 'unpaid' }`, once every HTLC offered for it is resolved. The queue's resolver for such an entry |
| `whenReadyToPay(run)` | `void` | Calls `run` once the node can pay: after a pending guardian restore, once the node is ready, and once some channel can carry an HTLC (or there is no channel); never after shutdown |

Entries survive a restart. The queue dispatches the restored ones once some channel can carry an HTLC after the start (or no channel is left that could), and looks again on every `channel:usable`, without waiting for another enqueue. A payment enqueued before that dispatches on its own; the restored ones wait. An entry left `dispatching` by a restart is checked against the node's record for its invoice before anything sends it again: a payment that was made is recorded `completed`, one whose HTLCs are still out stays `dispatching` until they resolve, and only one that paid nothing is queued again (issue #967). A `PaymentQueue` built without a `resolveInterrupted` option records such an entry `failed` instead, and one you build yourself dispatches restored entries only once you call `start()`. A dispatch whose HTLC is still out when the queue's own payment timeout fires (60 s by default) is not recorded `failed` either: it stays `dispatching`, its concurrency slot is released, and it is recorded from the node's outcome through the same check, `completed` when the payment settles and `failed` ("Payment was left pending by the dispatch and then failed without paying") once every HTLC resolved with nothing paid; it is not queued again in this process; a restart settles it like any interrupted entry, and one that paid nothing is then queued again. An entry the resolver could not answer (no node to ask yet) is asked about again on `start()` and on `resettle()`, which the daemon calls once a capsule resume has rebuilt the node; a `PaymentQueue` you build yourself calls `resettle()` itself. A `PaymentQueue` without a resolver records such a dispatch `failed` with its outcome unknown, for you to look up before paying that invoice again (issue #976). `amountSats` and `maxFeeSats` must be whole numbers of satoshis, zero or greater; `enqueuePayment` (and `POST /queue/add`) refuses anything else with `INVALID_PARAMS`. An entry whose amount is in its invoice rather than in `amountSats` waits for capacity for that amount just as one with `amountSats` does, instead of being dispatched unchecked into "no route" (issue #981); a `PaymentQueue` you build yourself gets this by passing `invoiceAmountSats`, a callback that returns the invoice's amount in whole satoshis, since the queue never decodes an invoice itself. The daemon and `BeignetNode` share one queue per process: the routes under `/queue` and `enqueuePayment`/`listQueue`/`cancelQueuedPayment` serve the same `PaymentQueue`, which persists through the node's current storage, so it keeps working after an in-process capsule restore replaces the database (issue #978).

#### Liquidity & Channel Intelligence

| Method | Returns | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `getLiquiditySnapshot()` | `LiquiditySnapshot` | Liquidity analysis with actionable recommendations (OPEN_CHANNEL, CLOSE_CHANNEL, REBALANCE) |
| `getChannelSuggestions(count?)` | `ChannelSuggestion[]` | Graph-based channel open suggestions scored by connectivity, capacity, freshness, relevance |
| `getFeeSnapshot()` | `FeeSnapshot \| null` | On-chain fee trend analysis with open/wait recommendation |
| `getAdvisorRecommendations()` | `AdvisorRecommendations` | Liquidity analysis plus the concrete circular-rebalance plan (read-only) |
| `rebalanceChannel(fromId, toId, amountSats, maxFeeSats)` | `Promise<RebalanceResult>` | Circular rebalance (self-payment out fromId, back in toId). Aborts without paying if the route fee exceeds `maxFeeSats` |
| `executeRebalances(budgetSatsPerDay?)` | `Promise<RebalanceExecutionSummary>` | Run the advisor's rebalance plan under a per-UTC-day fee budget (persisted; restarts never overspend the day) |

Automatic execution is **off by default**: pass `autoRebalance: { enabled: true, budgetSatsPerDay, minImbalancePct }` and/or `autoTuneFees: { enabled: true, intervalMs, floorPpm, ceilPpm }` in `BeignetNodeOptions` to turn on the periodic rebalance scan and routing-fee (ppm) auto-tuning.

#### Statistics

| Method | Returns | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `getStats(windowMs?)` | `NodeStats` | Payment stats with optional time window. Includes `avgPaymentTimeSec` and `avgFeePct` when data available |

#### Database Backup

| Method | Returns | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `backup(destPath)` | `Promise<void>` | Create online backup of SQLite database |

Storage encryption: the SQLite database is encrypted at rest by default with a
key derived (HKDF-SHA256) from the wallet's BIP39 seed. Sensitive payloads
(channel state, preimages, payment secrets, invoices, payments, chain-monitor
state) are AES-256-GCM encrypted, so backups made with `backup()` are encrypted
too; restoring one requires the same mnemonic. Pre-encryption databases are
migrated in place on first open. Set `storageEncryption: false` to opt out
(plaintext storage).

#### Static Channel Backup (SCB)

| Method | Returns | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `exportStaticChannelBackup()` | `{ encoded, channelCount, path }` | Build, encrypt, and write the static channel backup |

A static channel backup is a small, portable, versioned blob holding the
minimum needed to recover funds for every open channel without the full
database: per channel it records the channel id, peer node id and last-known
addresses, funding outpoint (txid internal byte order + output index),
capacity, per-channel key index, channel type, role, and taproot/anchor flags.
The blob is JSON encrypted with AES-256-GCM under a key derived
(HKDF-SHA256, info `beignet-scb-v1`) from the wallet's BIP39 seed, encoded as
`beignet-scb-v1:` + base64 - it is useless without the mnemonic.

The file is written atomically to `<dataDir>/channels.scb` and refreshed
automatically whenever the channel set changes (channel open/splice calls,
`channel:ready`, `channel:closed`, and channel resolution). Store a copy
off-machine (e.g. via `beignet backup scb <destPath>` or `GET /backup/scb`).

#### Automatic Peer Backup (BOLT 1 peer storage)

| Method / Command | Returns | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `getPeerRetrievedBackup()` | `{ encoded, createdAt, fromPeer, channelCount, source } \| null` | Most useful valid SCB a peer returned this session, directly (`source: 'scb'`) or embedded in a Recovery Capsule (`source: 'capsule'`, re-encoded under the wallet seed); an empty backup never displaces one naming channels (daemon: `GET /backup/peer-retrieved`; CLI: `beignet backup peer-retrieved`) |

With `peerStorageEnabled` (default true) the node advertises
`option_provide_storage` and uses it in both directions:

- **Our backup, held by peers.** Every SCB refresh is pushed as an opaque
  `peer_storage` blob to each connected peer that advertises the feature, and
  each such peer returns its held copy via `peer_storage_retrieval` on every
  reconnect. Recovery-from-nothing: reinstall with the mnemonic, connect to
  your old peers, read `GET /backup/peer-retrieved`, and feed its `encoded`
  blob to `POST /restore/scb`. Nothing is restored automatically - recovery
  stays explicit, and SCB recovery never broadcasts a stale commitment, so a
  peer returning an old blob is harmless.
- **Trust model.** Peers only ever see the seed-encrypted `beignet-scb-v1`
  ciphertext; without the mnemonic it is useless to them. Blobs returned by
  peers are untrusted input: anything that does not decrypt as our own SCB is
  ignored, and among valid ones only the newest (`createdAt`) is kept.
- **Storing for peers.** In return the node holds ONE blob (max 65531 bytes,
  newest wins) per peer it has a non-closed channel with or trusts
  (zero-conf trusted set), accepts at most one blob per peer per 60 seconds,
  and sends it back on every reconnect. Blobs from strangers are dropped.
  Stored blobs live in the `peer_storage_blobs` table, encrypted at rest like
  the rest of the database.

#### Restore

| Method / Command | Returns | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `restoreFromScb(encoded)` | `Promise<{ recovering, skipped, channelCount }>` | Recover channels from an SCB blob (daemon: `POST /restore/scb` with `{ encoded }` or `{ path }`; CLI: `beignet restore scb <file>`) |
| `beignet restore db <backupFile>` | JSON result | Copy a database backup into place (OFFLINE, local CLI operation - no daemon call) |
| `restoreFromGuardians()` | `Promise<{ exact, framesApplied, guardiansRepaired, epoch }>` | Restore from guardian replicas and start the node on the restored state (daemon: `POST /recovery/restore` with `{ confirm: true }`; CLI: `beignet recovery restore`) |
| `restoreFromCapsules({ unfenced? })` | `Promise<{ tier, channelCount, framesApplied, head, newestSeenHead, rejectedCandidates, restartRequired, unfenced?, recovering?, skipped? }>` | Peer-storage mode: restore from the Recovery Capsules storage peers returned this session (daemon: `POST /recovery/restore-capsule` with `{ confirm: true }`; CLI: `beignet recovery restore-capsule`). Tier 2 installs the exact state into a fresh database and holds the daemon until a restart; Tier 1 recovers the embedded SCB on the live node |

Three very different restore modes:

- **SCB restore = on-chain recovery only.** The backup holds no commitment
  state, so the channels themselves cannot be resumed. Each entry is
  reconstructed as a broadcast-banned channel (`ERRORED`, data-loss flagged -
  the node will never publish its own stale commitment), the funding outpoint
  is watched, and the peer is contacted so the normal reestablish exchange
  proves our state stale. The honest peer then force-closes with ITS
  commitment and the node sweeps only our `to_remote` balance to the wallet.
  Funds arrive on-chain after the peer's force-close confirms; in-flight
  HTLCs and anything beyond `to_remote` are not recoverable this way. The
  blob decrypts only with the wallet mnemonic, and a backup taken on another
  network is refused.

- **DB restore = full state.** `beignet restore db <backupFile>` copies a
  backup made with `backup()` over `<dataDir>/<network>.db`. The node must be
  STOPPED: the command refuses while a daemon holds the wallet's
  single-instance lock (and holds that lock itself during the copy). The file
  must be a real SQLite database (16-byte header check), any existing
  database is preserved at `<db>.pre-restore-<timestamp>` first, and stale
  `-wal`/`-shm` sidecars are moved aside so they cannot corrupt the restored
  file. The database is encrypted under the wallet seed, so the node must be
  started with the same mnemonic that made the backup. WARNING: restoring a
  stale database and going online can be unsafe (peers may prove the state
  stale); prefer the most recent backup, and rely on SCB recovery when in
  doubt.

- **Guardian restore = resume the channels.** With the Recovery Protocol in a
  guardian mode (below), the node's safety-critical state is replicated as an
  encrypted journal to a 2-of-3 guardian set, and a restore reconstructs the
  exact channel state and RESUMES the channels via `channel_reestablish`
  instead of force-closing. See "Guardian recovery" next.

#### Hosting a guardian (bolt8)

Any beignet node that listens for peers can serve the reference guardian to
other beignet nodes (docs/RECOVERY-GUARDIAN-WIRE.md 2.7, issue #699). Start
it with `BEIGNET_GUARDIAN_SERVE=true`; the guardian is reached at the node's
ordinary Lightning address, over a dedicated BOLT 8 session the writer opens
under a fresh key, so the host never learns which Lightning node it guards.
Its guardian id is derived from the node seed, so a node rebuilt from its seed
keeps the same id. A wallet adds it by resolving the node's URI
(`beignet recovery resolve-guardian <node id>@host:port`, or the daemon's
`POST /recovery/resolve-guardian`) to an entry of the form
`<guardianId>@bolt8://<node id>@host:port`, and pins that in
`BEIGNET_RECOVERY_GUARDIANS` like any other guardian. A host keeps serving
while its own writer lease is quarantined (the guardian-only lane), so nodes
that guard each other can restart together. Quotas
(`BEIGNET_GUARDIAN_MAX_BYTES`, `_MAX_SETS`) refuse new writes rather than
delete, because pruning a namespace wedges a stranger's node for good.

#### Rotating guardians

A wallet's guardian set is no longer fixed for life (docs/RECOVERY-GUARDIAN-WIRE.md
5.9, issue #701). `beignet recovery rotate-guardians <e> <e> <e>` (or
`POST /recovery/rotate-guardians`) moves the wallet to a new set, one member or
all three, without closing a channel: the daemon registers the namespace with
the incoming set under its current lease at the next generation, backfills the
retained journal until two of the incoming three hold the tip, switches in one
transaction, and retires the outgoing set with `ROTATE_SET`. A restore device
still configured with the outgoing set reads the rotation off any outgoing
guardian and follows it to the live set by itself; `GET /recovery/status`
reports the `generation`, `configuredSetStale` once the env lags the journal,
and `rotation.followed` on a boot that followed one. A previous device still
running on the outgoing set freezes the moment it sees the new generation, in
a capsule or in a guardian's answer. A rotation interrupted by a crash resumes
once the gate confirms; a retirement the outgoing set has not accepted yet is
retried in the background.

#### Guardian recovery (Recovery Protocol)

The Recovery Protocol (docs/RECOVERY-PROTOCOL.md) is configured entirely
through env/config, following the other `BEIGNET_*` settings:

```bash
BEIGNET_RECOVERY_MODE=quorum   # off | peer-storage | async-remote | quorum
BEIGNET_RECOVERY_GUARDIANS=<64-hex-pubkey>@https://g1.example,<64-hex-pubkey>@https://g2.example,<64-hex-pubkey>@http://<v3>.onion
BEIGNET_RECOVERY_PROFILE=crash-v1   # optional; crash-v1 is the only value
BEIGNET_RECOVERY_REESTABLISH_HOLD_MS=600000   # peer-storage only; 0 disables
BEIGNET_RECOVERY_AUTO_APPLY=false   # peer-storage only; apply the best capsule on an empty boot, no operator call
BEIGNET_RECOVERY_AUTO_APPLY_SETTLE_MS=15000   # wait this long after the first capsule for slower replicas
BEIGNET_RECOVERY_AUTO_APPLY_MAX_WAIT_MS=120000   # never wait longer than this; must fit inside the hold
```

- `off` (default): nothing changes.
- `peer-storage`: the encrypted recovery journal is kept locally and a
  Recovery Capsule (SCB + journal) is distributed over BOLT 1 peer storage.
  No guardians involved, so no fencing between devices either. Restore:
  boot the same mnemonic on a FRESH data dir in this mode (an empty node
  pushes nothing, so the peers keep the capsule), connect to the peers the
  node had channels with, check `capsules` on `GET /recovery/status`, then
  `POST /recovery/restore-capsule` with `{ "confirm": true }`. Connecting
  before you restore is safe: in this mode the node HOLDS a peer's
  `channel_reestablish` for a channel the empty database has no record of
  instead of answering it with the BOLT 1 unknown-channel error, which would
  make the peer force-close the channel the restore is about to resume
  (issue #462). `GET /recovery/status` lists each held peer under
  `node.heldReestablish` with the `expiresAt` you have to beat; past that the
  error goes out as before. The window is
  `BEIGNET_RECOVERY_REESTABLISH_HOLD_MS` (default 600000; 0 answers
  immediately) and it is granted once per peer and channel. When an
  inline journal validates (Tier 2) the exact state is installed into a
  fresh database, the daemon holds in the `restart-required` state (every
  route but the recovery surface answers 503 `NODE_RESTART_REQUIRED`) and a
  restart resumes the channels; the previous database is kept beside it as
  `<network>.db.pre-capsule-restore-<timestamp>`, and API-key revocations,
  webhooks and peer addresses follow into the restored one. The swap is
  crash-safe: a marker (`<network>.capsule-restore.json`) lets the next boot
  finish an interrupted swap. Otherwise (Tier 1) the embedded SCB is
  recovered on the live node like `POST /restore/scb`.

  A Tier 2 restore brings the channels back HOLDABLE, not fully live. A
  capsule is best-effort recency by construction and a compatible
  `channel_reestablish` proves compatibility, not recency, so every restored
  channel carries `restoreRecencyUnproven` on `GET /recovery/status` for the
  rest of its life. While it is set the daemon never force-closes that
  channel on its own initiative (a peer error and the reestablish/errored
  timeout backstops are all held, and the channel asks its peer to close
  instead), and the channel takes no new HTLCs, since the on-chain HTLC
  deadline backstops that would enforce them can never fire. Existing HTLCs
  still settle and fail, and the balance is intact. A cooperative close is
  refused by default in BOTH directions too: a mutual close pays out the
  balances the restored row carries, and a stale capsule's allocation can
  only be the peer-favourable one, since any payment received after the
  checkpoint is missing from it. An ERRORED one reports
  `status: "restore_recency_unproven"` rather than `force_closing`. The
  exits are the peer closing, or the operator's labelled acknowledgement on
  either close:
  `beignet channel close <id> --accept-stale-state-risk`
  (`POST /channel/close` with `acceptStaleStateRisk: true`) accepts the
  stale-split risk and covers the whole negotiation, and
  `beignet channel forceclose <id> --accept-stale-state-risk`
  (`POST /channel/forceclose` with `acceptStaleStateRisk: true`) accepts
  that publishing a commitment the peer may already have revoked forfeits
  the whole channel balance. Both are refused without the flag. The FFOR
  enforcement routes publish the same commitment and take the same flag:
  `POST /ffor/enforce`, and `POST /ffor/recover` with
  `forceCloseIfUnreachable: true`, are refused on such a channel without
  `acceptStaleStateRisk: true` (issue #908).

  The same hold has a second origin (issue #907): a peer whose
  `channel_reestablish` claims this node is behind (a `next_revocation_number`
  above anything this node released) without showing the per-commitment
  secret that would prove it, all zeroes included. The channel fails with a
  wire error, is ERRORED, and carries `reestablishRecencyUnproven` on
  `GET /recovery/status` with `status: "reestablish_recency_unproven"`: no
  automatic close, no new HTLCs, the peer asked to close on every reconnect.
  A hostile peer can put a healthy channel here at no cost, so the exit is
  the same labelled acknowledgement,
  `beignet channel forceclose <id> --accept-stale-state-risk`, refused
  without it with wording for this case.

  A third origin is a LOCAL fault (issue #919): this node's own
  `channel_reestablish` could not be built, because its shachain store holds
  no per-commitment secret at the index its revocation counter names. BOLT 2
  permits an all-zero `your_last_per_commitment_secret` only at
  `next_revocation_number` 0, so there is no honest value to send above it and
  nothing is sent: the peer gets a BOLT 1 error saying only that this node
  cannot produce the message (naming the missing secret would tell a peer
  where its own revoked commitments may go unpunished), and the operator gets
  a `node:error` with code `REESTABLISH_SECRET_MISSING` naming the channel,
  the revocation index and the exit, plus a `reestablish_secret_missing`
  structured log. The channel carries `reestablishSecretMissing` on
  `GET /recovery/status` with `status: "reestablish_secret_missing"` and the
  same hold: no automatic close, no new HTLCs, the peer asked to close on
  every reconnect, and
  `beignet channel forceclose <id> --accept-stale-state-risk` as the operator
  exit, refused without the flag with wording for this case. The hold is
  PERMANENT: a shachain store cannot regrow a secret it never wrote, so the
  peer's close and the acknowledged force close are the only two exits.
  `GET /channel/<id>/diagnostics` reports it as `HELD_SECRET_MISSING`.

  Either hold disarms the on-chain HTLC deadline backstops, so each one
  that declines to close announces it: a `node:error` with code
  `HTLC_DEADLINE_HELD` (on the SSE stream and the `onError` callback),
  carrying the channel, the HTLC id and payment hash, its `cltv_expiry`,
  the current height, which hold it is and the acknowledged force close
  that is the exit. Throttled per HTLC per backstop, roughly hourly, so a
  hold standing for weeks does not flood the stream. A peer can put a
  channel into the reestablish hold at no cost, and only an operator can
  take it out before a CLTV deadline passes, so these are the events to
  alert on.

  The same acknowledgement is required on those FFOR routes for the
  reestablish and secret-missing origins. The `ffor:enforce` event carries
  `restoreRecencyUnproven: true`, `reestablishRecencyUnproven: true`,
  `reestablishSecretMissing: true`, or several of them, matching the
  channel's holds, so the embedder knows to ask.
- `async-remote`: the journal also replicates in the background to the
  guardian set (exactly three `pubkey@url` entries; the pubkey is the
  guardian's x-only identity key). Wire traffic never waits on guardians.
- `quorum`: safety-critical wire messages (`revoke_and_ack`,
  `update_fulfill_htlc`, ...) are additionally HELD until the journal frame
  behind them is acknowledged by 2 of 3 guardians. This is the strongest
  tier: a device destroyed at any moment restores on new hardware and
  resumes its channels, and the epoch takeover fences the old device if it
  ever comes back.

Operational notes:

- A malformed guardian entry, a wrong guardian count, or guardians configured
  without a guardian mode REFUSE daemon startup: silently dropping a guardian
  would change the quorum arithmetic. An unknown `BEIGNET_RECOVERY_MODE`
  value falls back to `off` (the usual typo rule), but never silently: a
  database already marked quorum then refuses to start unbarriered at the
  library level, and configured guardians beside a typo'd mode refuse too.
- In the guardian modes the node boots QUARANTINED: it makes no peer
  connections until a guardian quorum confirms this device still owns the
  writer lease (split-brain protection). If the guardians are unreachable at
  boot, the daemon and its API come up, peer traffic waits, and confirmation
  retries on a backoff; `GET /recovery/status` shows `gate: "quarantined"`.
  A normal restart does NOT need the guardians reachable: the persisted
  lease short-circuits the boot decision, only the confirmation waits.
- Once confirmed, an idle node re-checks its lease with the guardians every
  `BEIGNET_RECOVERY_LEASE_CHECK_MS` (default 300000; 0 disables) so a device
  superseded while parked reports `fenced` within that window instead of at
  its next commit or restart. An outage never changes the gate.
- Restore-from-nothing: start the daemon with the same mnemonic, the same
  guardian set, and a FRESH data dir. The boot detects the namespace on the
  guardians and holds in a restore-pending state where only
  `GET /recovery/status`, `POST /recovery/restore`, `GET /events`,
  `GET /openapi.json` and `POST /stop` answer (everything else returns 503
  `NODE_RESTORE_PENDING`; `/health` reads as not-ready, which is true).
  `POST /recovery/restore` with `{ "confirm": true }` performs the guardian
  takeover, streams `recovery:restore-progress` events over SSE/webhooks,
  builds the node on the restored state, and returns the restore report.
  The confirm flag is required because the takeover permanently fences any
  still-running previous device. The restore is crash-safe and re-runnable.
- Lost the guardian set too: every capsule a guardian-mode node pushes names
  its guardians. Boot the fresh data dir in `peer-storage` mode (it pushes
  nothing while empty), connect to the peers the node had channels with,
  read `capsules.best.guardians` on `GET /recovery/status` (`guardianId` plus
  transports; credentials are never reported there), rebuild
  `BEIGNET_RECOVERY_GUARDIANS` as `<guardianId>@<url>` entries and restart in
  the guardian mode: that boot holds restore-pending as above. When the
  guardians require a transport credential, `beignet recovery
  capsule-guardians` (`POST /recovery/capsule-guardians`, admin scope,
  `{ "confirm": true }`) hands back the set WITH credentials as config-file
  entries: put them under `recoveryGuardians` in the config file as objects
  `{ "guardianId", "url", "auth" }` (the env form stays `pubkey@url`; a URL
  must not carry userinfo, credentials go in `auth`). A running guardian-mode
  node only reports a capsule's set, it never adopts one; a set that differs
  from the configured one is logged as a warning.
- `POST /recovery/restore-capsule` refuses a capsule that names guardians
  by default (409 `CAPSULE_RESTORE_GUARDIAN_BACKED`): that state belongs to
  a guardian-backed namespace and restores through the guardian set with
  fencing, not from peer storage, and not by force-closing channels the
  guardians could resume exactly. The emergency SCB-only path is
  unchanged: `GET /backup/peer-retrieved` plus `POST /restore/scb`. A
  quorum-durability journal is refused whether or not the capsule names
  guardians (409 `CAPSULE_RESTORE_QUORUM_NAMESPACE`; capsules from before
  locators existed carry none): it cannot boot without its quorum.
- Guardian set gone for good: `{ "confirm": true, "unfenced": true }`
  (`beignet recovery restore-capsule --unfenced`) is the labelled escape
  hatch from spec 5.7. It restores the capsule anyway and CANNOT fence the
  previous writer: if that device still runs, it keeps acting on the same
  channels. The report carries the named guardians under `unfenced`, and
  the restore progress stream says so. It is the only exception to the
  default refusal, and it never applies to a quorum-durability journal:
  such a chain refuses to boot without its quorum, so its only paths are
  the guardians or the SCB route.
- Zero-touch peer-storage restore (issue #690): with
  `BEIGNET_RECOVERY_AUTO_APPLY=true` the daemon performs the capsule restore
  itself on a boot whose database is empty. Every capsule a storage peer
  returns is announced as `recovery:capsule-retrieved`; the first arrival
  opens a settle window, and the best capsule is applied once every
  connected storage peer has answered and
  `BEIGNET_RECOVERY_AUTO_APPLY_SETTLE_MS` (default 15 s) has passed, or at
  `BEIGNET_RECOVERY_AUTO_APPLY_MAX_WAIT_MS` (default 2 minutes) at the
  latest, which must fit inside the reestablish hold. A Tier 2 install then
  rebuilds the node in-process on the restored database (no restart;
  `recovery:restored` carries `resumed: true`), and channels the capsule's
  journal did not carry are named in a `capsule:uncovered` progress event
  and recovered through the peer (they close safely, the SCB degradation).
  The flag automates an UNFENCED adoption: local durability cannot fence a
  previous device that still runs, so an embedder asks the operator once
  (at seed import) rather than defaulting it on. Refusals are the manual
  route's, made once and reported under `autoApply.lastReason` on
  `GET /recovery/status` (phases `idle`, `settling`, `applying`, `applied`,
  `refused`); a database that already holds state is never a target.
- Recovery events relayed over SSE and webhooks (always on):
  `recovery:durable`, `recovery:fenced`, `recovery:backfill-lost`,
  `recovery:reestablish-held`, `recovery:capsule-retrieved`,
  `recovery:guardian_unreachable`, `recovery:restore-progress`,
  `recovery:restored`.

#### Health & Monitoring

| Method | Returns | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `getHealth()` | `HealthInfo` | Node health: status, uptime, block height, electrum, peers, channels, graph |
| `getChannelHealth(channelId)` | `ChannelHealth \| null` | Channel liquidity health: balance %, HTLC slot usage, warnings |
| `getMainnetReadiness()` | `ReadinessReport` | Weighted readiness checklist (storage, chain backend, channels, fees, etc.) |
| `getMetrics()` | `string` | Prometheus text exposition format metrics (channels, payments, balances, peers, uptime, etc.) |
| `triggerBackup()` | `Promise<void>` | Trigger an on-demand backup (requires `backupPath` configured) |
| `getActionLog(options?)` | `ActionLogEntry[]` | Query persistent action log. `options: { category?, since?, limit? }` |
| `getNodeUri(externalHost?)` | `string \| null` | Node connection URI (`pubkey@host:port`). Returns null if not listening. |
| `getNode()` | `LightningNode` | Access the underlying LightningNode for event wiring |

#### Waiting

| Method | Returns | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `waitForReady(timeoutMs?)` | `Promise<void>` | Wait for node to be fully operational (peers reconnected, channels restored). Default 30s timeout. |
| `waitForChannelReady(channelId, timeoutMs?)` | `Promise<void>` | Wait for channel to reach NORMAL state (default 60s timeout) |
| `waitForPayment(paymentHash, timeoutMs?)` | `Promise<PaymentInfo>` | Wait for payment to settle (default 60s timeout) |

#### Spending Limits

> **SEMANTICS CHANGE: the daily spend limit is now a COMBINED Lightning +
> on-chain budget.** It previously covered Lightning payments only. If you
> rely on `dailySpendLimitSats`, external on-chain sends now consume the same
> budget: `sendOnchain` (`POST /send`) and `sendMaxOnchain`
> (`POST /send-max`) each count **amount + fee** against the daily limit and
> are rejected with `SPENDING_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` once it is exhausted. For
> send-max the check runs against the actual computed sweep total before
> broadcast. An address-targeted `spliceOut` and `sendDirectFunding`
> (`POST /direct-funding/send`) count the same way; direct funding is charged
> its amount plus the fee ceiling it was given, because the exact fee is only
> known once the receiver has built the transaction. Excluded by design (they
> are not external spends): `consolidateUtxos` (self-pay), our own channel
> opens/splices/funding, and
> `bumpFeeOnchain`/`boostOnchain` (fee-only). PSBT building is also not
> counted (nothing is broadcast). Resets at midnight UTC.

Every invoice payment (`payInvoice`, `payInvoiceSafe`, `payInvoiceWithRetry`,
`sendPaymentAsync`, the queue and their routes) is checked and recorded at the
amount that actually gets paid: the invoice's own amount whenever it carries
one, and `amountSats` only for an amount-less invoice. A fractional msat amount
rounds up. `validatePayment`, `estimatePayment` and `estimateRouteFee` preview
the same amount. `payOffer` is checked and recorded the same way, against the
amount of the BOLT 12 invoice the payee returns for the offer, which is what
gets paid whatever `amountSats` asked for.

The ledger is persisted (issue #977): a restart within the UTC day resumes
the day's total, and the budget a payment still holds while its HTLC is out
comes back with it. A Lightning payment is charged when it settles, once,
whichever path sent it (`payInvoice`, `sendKeysend`, `payOffer`,
`sendPaymentAsync`), including a settle that lands after `payInvoice` gave up
waiting or after a restart. Before this the counters were per-process, so
every restart started the day at zero. Failed payments are not charged, and
a payment that fails with nothing left in flight gives its budget back at
once. A payment cancelled while its HTLC is out keeps its budget held until
that HTLC settles or fails back, or the 24h window ends: the HTLC cannot be
retracted, and releasing the budget on the cancel would let it be spent
twice. `getDailySpendInfo().pendingSats` is what in-flight payments hold,
and `remainingSats` subtracts it, so it is what the next payment can pass.

| Method | Returns | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `getDailySpendInfo()` | `DailySpendInfo` | Current combined limit status: `{ totalSats, lightningSats, onchainSats, limitSats, remainingSats, pendingSats, resetsAt }` plus the legacy `spentSats` field (equals `totalSats`) for back-compat |

#### Drain Mode

| Method | Returns | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `setDraining(enabled)` | `void` | Enable/disable drain mode. When enabled, every payment entry point (`payInvoice()`, `sendPaymentAsync()`, `sendKeysend()`, `payOffer()`) throws `SERVICE_DRAINING`. `payOffer()` re-checks after the invoice request, so a drain that starts during it still stops the payment. |
| `isDraining()` | `boolean` | Whether the node is currently draining |
| `hasPendingPayments()` | `boolean` | Whether there are in-flight payments |

#### Lifecycle

| Method | Returns | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `gracefulShutdown(timeoutMs?)` | `Promise<void>` | Graceful shutdown: drains in-flight HTLCs, persists state, then stops the node, then the on-chain wallet, then closes the database, so the wallet's last writes land (default 30s timeout) |
| `destroy()` | `Promise<void>` | Immediate shutdown (stops the node, then the on-chain wallet, then closes the database) |

### Events

`BeignetNode` extends `EventEmitter`. All event data is JSON-safe (hex strings, numbers — no Buffer or bigint).

```typescript
node.on('payment:received', (info: PaymentInfo) => { ... });
node.on('payment:sent', (info: PaymentInfo) => { ... });
node.on('payment:failed', (info: PaymentInfo) => { ... });
node.on('invoice:settled', ({ paymentHash, bolt11, amountSats }) => { ... }); // an invoice WE issued was paid (keysend fires only payment:received)
node.on('hold:accepted', ({ paymentHash, state, heldAmountMsat, htlcCount }) => { ... }); // per-part running total: compare with the full expected msat before funding; also hold:settled and hold:cancelled (+ reason)
node.on('channel:opening', ({ channelId, fundingTxid }) => { ... }); // funding negotiated + broadcast/watched
node.on('channel:ready', ({ channelId }) => { ... });
node.on('channel:pending-close', ({ channelId, initiator }) => { ... }); // coop close initiated ('local' | 'remote')
node.on('channel:force-closing', ({ channelId, initiator }) => { ... }); // our force-close broadcast or peer unilateral detected
node.on('channel:closed', ({ channelId }) => { ... });
node.on('channel:resolved', ({ channelId }) => { ... }); // terminal: every on-chain output of the close irrevocably swept
node.on('htlc:forwarded', ({ inChannelId, outChannelId, amountInMsat, amountOutMsat, feeMsat }) => { ... }); // a forward settled (msat values as strings)
node.on('swap:funded', ({ swapId, paymentHash, state, onchainSat, fundingHeight }) => { ... }); // reverse swap provider (issue #737); also swap:created, swap:held, swap:funding, swap:claimed, swap:settled, swap:refund-broadcast, swap:refunded, swap:hold-cancelled, swap:exposed, swap:failed
node.on('swap:claim-confirmed', ({ swapId, direction, paymentHash, claimTxid }) => { ... }); // submarine swap provider (issue #743); also swap:funding-seen, swap:funding-lost, swap:paying, swap:payment-unresolved, swap:preimage, swap:claim-broadcast, swap:payment-failed, swap:cancelled; every swap event carries direction
node.on('htlc:fulfilled', ({ channelId, htlcId }) => { ... }); // an HTLC we offered was fulfilled
node.on('htlc:failed', ({ channelId, htlcId }) => { ... });
node.on('peer:connect', ({ pubkey }) => { ... });
node.on('peer:disconnect', ({ pubkey }) => { ... });
node.on('node:error', ({ code, message, timestamp }) => { ... });
node.on('node:ready', () => { ... });           // node fully operational
node.on('payment:retry', ({ paymentHash, attempt, maxRetries, nextRetryMs, error }) => { ... });
node.on('backup:completed', ({ path, timestamp }) => { ... });
node.on('backup:failed', ({ path, error, timestamp }) => { ... });
node.on('electrum:failover', ({ from, to, timestamp }) => { ... }); // auto-reconnects to next server
node.on('log', (entry: LogEntry) => { ... });  // structured logs
```

The `log` event fires based on the `logLevel` option. Set `logLevel: 'debug'` for verbose output, `'silent'` to suppress. Pass a `logger` (any `ILogger`, e.g. `createConsoleLogger(level)` from the main package) to also receive those entries as `logger.debug/info/warn/error(message, meta)` calls; the daemon uses this with `--log-level` / `BEIGNET_LOG_LEVEL` to print diagnostics to stderr (silent by default).

### Channel States

Channels progress through these states:

| State | Can Send Payments? | Description |
|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| `AWAITING_FUNDING_CONFIRMED` | No | Funding tx broadcast, waiting for on-chain confirmations |
| `AWAITING_CHANNEL_READY` | No | Funding confirmed, exchanging `channel_ready` messages |
| `NORMAL` | **Yes** | Fully operational — HTLCs can be sent and received |
| `AWAITING_REESTABLISH` | No | Reconnected after disconnect, re-syncing state |
| `SHUTTING_DOWN` | No | Cooperative close initiated, no new HTLCs |
| `NEGOTIATING_CLOSING` | No | Exchanging closing fee proposals |
| `CLOSED` | No | Channel closed (cooperative or forced) |

Only channels in `NORMAL` state can send/receive payments.

### Error Handling

All errors throw `BeignetError` with a `code`, `message`, and optional `failureCode` (BOLT 4):

```typescript
import { BeignetError, isRetryableError, isPermanentFailure } from 'beignet/cli';

try {
  await node.payInvoice(bolt11);
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof BeignetError) {
    console.log(err.code);        // 'PAYMENT_FAILED', 'PAYMENT_TIMEOUT', etc.
    console.log(err.message);     // 'Payment failed: unknown_next_peer'
    console.log(err.failureCode); // BOLT 4 failure code (e.g. 0x400f)

    if (isRetryableError(err)) {
      // Transient failure — safe to retry (no route, timeout, temp failure)
    }
    if (isPermanentFailure(err)) {
      // Permanent failure — give up (expired, invalid, PERM flag set)
    }
  }
}
```

Error codes (`BeignetErrorCode` enum). The HTTP column is the status the daemon
answers with: **4xx** when the request cannot be served as written, **409** when
the node's own state conflicts with it, **502/504** when the trouble is upstream
of us (the peer, the network), **503** when waiting genuinely changes the answer,
and **500** only when the node itself failed. An agent can retry on 5xx and must
not repeat a 4xx unchanged.

| Code | Category | HTTP | Description |
|------|----------|------|-------------|
| `WALLET_CREATE_FAILED` | Wallet | 500 | On-chain wallet initialization failed |
| `ADDRESS_FAILED` | Wallet | 500 | Could not derive new address |
| `SEND_FAILED` | Wallet | 500 | On-chain send failed |
| `REFRESH_FAILED` | Wallet | 500 | Wallet sync failed |
| `NOT_BOOSTABLE` | Wallet | 409 | Transaction cannot be fee-bumped (unknown, confirmed, or not RBF/CPFP-able) |
| `NOTHING_TO_CONSOLIDATE` | Wallet | 409 | Consolidation needs at least two spendable UTXOs |
| `INSTANCE_ALREADY_RUNNING` | Wallet | n/a | Another instance holds the data-dir lock (startup only, never over HTTP) |
| `PAYMENT_FAILED` | Payments | 502 | Lightning payment failed |
| `PAYMENT_TIMEOUT` | Payments | 504 | Payment did not settle within timeout. The payment is failed only when no HTLC is out for it; with one still in flight the record stays `PENDING` until it resolves, no further route is tried, and the record is failed when the HTLC fails or its on-chain timeout resolves; the message says so (issue #976) |
| `INVOICE_EXPIRED` | Payments | 410 | Invoice has expired |
| `NO_ROUTE` | Payments | 502 | No route found to destination |
| `INVALID_INVOICE` | Payments | 400 | BOLT 11 string failed to parse |
| `INVALID_OFFER` | Payments | 400 | BOLT 12 offer string failed to parse |
| `INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE` | Payments | 409 | Not enough balance to send, or to fund the requested open |
| `DUPLICATE_PAYMENT` | Payments | 409 | Payment with this hash already completed, or still has an HTLC out; `payInvoiceSafe` returns the existing record instead |
| `SPENDING_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` | Payments | 403 | Daily spending limit exceeded (permanent) |
| `CHANNEL_NOT_FOUND` | Channels | 404 | Channel ID does not exist |
| `CHANNEL_NOT_READY` | Channels | 409 | Channel is not in NORMAL state |
| `OPEN_FAILED` | Channels | 409 | Channel open failed |
| `CLOSE_FAILED` | Channels | 500 | Cooperative close failed |
| `FORCE_CLOSE_FAILED` | Channels | 500 | Force close failed |
| `ZERO_CONF_FAILED` | Channels | 500 | Zero-conf channel open failed |
| `FUNDING_PROVIDER_REQUIRED` | Channels | 409 | The node has no funding provider able to serve this open or splice |
| `FEE_ESTIMATE_NOT_READY` | Channels | 503 | The fee estimator has not delivered its first sample; retry shortly |
| `SPLICING_NOT_NEGOTIATED` | Channels | 409 | `option_splice`/`option_quiesce` is missing on one side of the pair |
| `SPLICE_REFUSED` | Channels | 409 | The channel exists but would not start the splice (state, peer, size) |
| `SPLICE_BUSY` | Channels | 503 | The channel would splice but is held off by a state that ends on its own; retry the same request |
| `PEER_NOT_CONNECTED` | Peers | 409 | Peer is not connected |
| `HOLD_RESOLUTION_PENDING` | Invoices | 503 | `settleHoldInvoice`/`cancelHoldInvoice` left HTLCs parked for the hash: a channel refused them, or a settle or cancel is already under way. The hold is live; do not switch to the other action |
| `JIT_REFUSED` | Invoices | 400 | JIT receive: the LSP declined the intent, quoted above the wallet's ceiling, or answered with no intercept scid; the message carries the reason |
| `SWAP_NOT_CANCELLABLE` | Swaps | 409 | Reverse swap provider: the swap is past CREATED/HELD, so it resolves on chain by claim or refund and cannot be cancelled |
| `JIT_TIMEOUT` | Invoices | 504 | JIT receive: the LSP never answered the intent inside the ack window (retryable) |
| `CONNECT_FAILED` | Peers | 502 | Dialing the peer failed |
| `CONNECT_TIMEOUT` | Peers | 504 | The peer did not answer the dial in time |
| `NODE_DESTROYED` | Node | 409 | Operation on destroyed node |
| `INVALID_PARAMS` | Node | 400 | Missing or invalid request parameters |
| `NOT_FOUND` | Node | 404 | Resource not found |
| `BODY_TOO_LARGE` | Node | 413 | Request body exceeds 1MB |
| `MNEMONIC_REQUIRES_AUTH` | Node | 403 | apiToken or apiKeys required for mnemonic access |
| `UNAUTHORIZED` | Node | 401 | Invalid or missing auth token / API key |
| `FORBIDDEN` | Node | 403 | Valid API key without the scope a route requires |
| `SERVICE_DRAINING` | Node | 409 | Node is draining, no new payments accepted |
| `IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT` | HTTP | 409 | Same idempotency key used with different request body |
| `RATE_LIMITED` | HTTP | 429 | Too many requests (token bucket rate limiter) |

`SEND_FAILED`, `CLOSE_FAILED`, `FORCE_CLOSE_FAILED`, `ZERO_CONF_FAILED` and the
`PSBT_*` codes keep the 500 default on purpose: each covers both caller-state
problems and genuine node faults, so no single status is honest until they are
split. The two close codes have had their caller-state half split off at the
source: `POST /channel/close` and `POST /channel/forceclose` answer **400
`INVALID_PARAMS`** for a malformed channel id and **404 `CHANNEL_NOT_FOUND`**
for a channel the node does not hold, so a 500 from either now means a channel
that exists and would not close.

**Retryability is one decision, not two.** Every code answered with 502, 503 or
504 is one `isRetryableError()` returns true for, and a test walks the status map
to keep them from drifting apart. The status also reads the BOLT 4 failure code:
a `PAYMENT_FAILED` carrying the PERM flag answers **409**, not `PAYMENT_FAILED`'s
usual 502, because the payee refuses it every time. Failure bodies carry
`failureCode` so a caller can make the same judgment itself.

#### Typed Payment Errors (Lightning Layer)

When a send is refused, the underlying `LightningNode` throws a `LightningPaymentError` with a typed `code` property. The CLI layer catches these and maps them to `BeignetErrorCode`, in `payInvoice()`, `sendPaymentAsync()`, `sendKeysend()` and `payOffer()` alike (issue #991), so every payment route answers a refusal with its own code and HTTP status. When driving the `LightningNode` directly you can import and check them yourself:

```typescript
import { LightningPaymentError, LightningErrorCode } from 'beignet/cli';

try {
  await node.payInvoice(bolt11);
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof LightningPaymentError) {
    switch (err.code) {
      case LightningErrorCode.NO_ROUTE:         // No path to destination
      case LightningErrorCode.DUPLICATE_PAYMENT: // Payment hash already paid or in-flight
      case LightningErrorCode.NO_CHANNEL_TO_HOP: // No channel to first hop peer
      case LightningErrorCode.FEE_EXCEEDS_MAX:   // Route fee exceeds maxFeeMsat
      case LightningErrorCode.MISSING_AMOUNT:     // Amount-less invoice with no amount
      case LightningErrorCode.INVALID_INVOICE:    // Cannot determine payee
      case LightningErrorCode.INVOICE_EXPIRED:    // Invoice has expired
    }
  }
}
```

`LightningPaymentError` extends `Error`, so existing `catch` blocks continue to work. The `code` property enables programmatic error handling without string matching.

#### Typed Channel-Open Refusals (Lightning Layer)

A channel open the engine refuses on the caller's own arguments (a push toward a dual-fund peer, a `pushSats` above the funding amount, a non-positive fee rate, `max` without a pinned rate, a trusted open toward a peer that never negotiated `option_zeroconf`) throws an `InvalidChannelOpenError`. Every open entry point converts it to `INVALID_PARAMS`, so the daemon answers **HTTP 400 with the engine's message** instead of scrubbing it to a generic 500. Node faults stay untyped and still answer 500.

```typescript
import { BeignetError } from 'beignet/cli';

try {
  node.openChannel(peerPubkey, 100_000, 50_000);
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof BeignetError && err.code === 'INVALID_PARAMS') {
    // The request cannot be served as written; err.message says why.
  }
}
```

`InvalidChannelOpenError` is what an embedder driving a raw `LightningNode` catches (it is exported from `beignet/cli` too); on `BeignetNode` and over HTTP the refusal always arrives as `INVALID_PARAMS`. A splice refused the same way throws the sibling `InvalidSpliceError`, which converts identically.

#### Typed Channel-Funding State Refusals (Lightning Layer)

A request the node cannot serve for its **own** state or configuration is a different thing: the request is well formed, this node cannot serve it as things stand. `INVALID_PARAMS` would be a lie, so these throw a `ChannelFundingUnavailableError` carrying a `code`, and each code answers with a status of its own.

| `ChannelFundingUnavailableCode` | Reaches the caller as | HTTP |
|---|---|---|
| `FUNDING_PROVIDER_REQUIRED` | `FUNDING_PROVIDER_REQUIRED` | 409 |
| `INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE` | `INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE` | 409 |
| `FEE_ESTIMATE_NOT_READY` | `FEE_ESTIMATE_NOT_READY` | 503 |
| `CHANNEL_NOT_FOUND` | `CHANNEL_NOT_FOUND` | 404 |

```typescript
import { BeignetError, isRetryableError } from 'beignet/cli';

try {
  node.openChannel(peerPubkey, 100_000, undefined, 5, true); // max open
} catch (err) {
  if (err instanceof BeignetError && isRetryableError(err)) {
    // FEE_ESTIMATE_NOT_READY: the estimator's first sample lands in
    // milliseconds, so a retry succeeds. Everything else needs a decision.
  }
}
```

Node faults are still deliberately untyped, so they keep scrubbing to a generic **500** with the detail in the daemon log only.

#### Splice Refusals

A splice starts asynchronously, so a refusal is **returned**, not thrown: `spliceIn`/`spliceOut` answer `{ ok: false, error, code }`. The daemon converts that code at the route boundary, so `POST /channel/splice-in` and `POST /channel/splice-out` answer a refused splice as a failure envelope, never a 200 carrying `ok: false` under `result`.

| `SpliceRefusalCode` | Reaches the caller as | HTTP |
|---|---|---|
| `CHANNEL_NOT_FOUND` | `CHANNEL_NOT_FOUND` | 404 |
| `INVALID_PARAMS` | `INVALID_PARAMS` | 400 |
| `INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE` | `INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE` | 409 |
| `FUNDING_PROVIDER_REQUIRED` | `FUNDING_PROVIDER_REQUIRED` | 409 |
| `SPLICING_NOT_NEGOTIATED` | `SPLICING_NOT_NEGOTIATED` | 409 |
| `SPLICE_BUSY` | `SPLICE_BUSY` | 503 |
| `SPLICE_REFUSED` | `SPLICE_REFUSED` | 409 |

A 2xx means the splice **started**. Its outcome arrives on the `splice:complete`, `splice:aborted`, `splice:reverted` and `node:error` events (a depth-locked splice whose external input was spent elsewhere is reverted to the old funding by agreement with the peer, issue #760; `splice:conflicted` and `node:error` code `SPLICE_INPUT_CONFLICT` precede it).

`SPLICE_BUSY` is the one refusal to retry unchanged: the channel would splice but is held off by a state that ends on its own (a splice already in progress, a previous abort still awaiting the peer's echo, a quiescence session the peer owns, HTLCs still settling, the peer reconnecting). `isRetryableError` agrees; every other refusal code is permanent for the request as sent.

The CLI is a thin HTTP client. `init` and `start` are handled locally; all other commands send requests to the daemon on `127.0.0.1:2112`.

All output is JSON. Add `--pretty` for indented output.

### Setup

```bash
beignet init [--network regtest] [--alias mynode]
beignet start [--port 2112] [--host 0.0.0.0] [--daemon] [--anchors] [--api-token mysecret] \
  [--backup-path /path/to/backup.db] [--backup-interval 21600000] \
  [--daily-spend-limit 100000] [--tls-cert /path/cert.pem] [--tls-key /path/key.pem] \
  [--htlc-events] [--log-level info]
beignet stop
```

Seed generation is CLI-only: `beignet init` creates the mnemonic (or you supply
one via `BEIGNET_MNEMONIC`/config); the daemon never generates or replaces a
seed. `GET /mnemonic` only reveals the configured seed, and only when
`apiToken` or `apiKeys` is set (admin scope).

### API key management

```bash
beignet auth keys            # list named API keys (names, scopes, revoked/expired,
                             # expiresAt/rotatedAt; never secrets)
beignet auth revoke <name>   # disable a named key immediately (persisted;
                             # survives restarts)
beignet auth rotate <name>   # mint a new random secret for a named key;
                             # printed ONCE, cannot be retrieved again
```

Any command accepts `--api-key <secret>` (alias of `--api-token`) or the
`BEIGNET_API_KEY` env var to authenticate with a named key instead of the
legacy token.

beignet wallet descriptors
# BIP 380 descriptors for all four address types (public keys only, with checksums):
# {"ok":true,"result":{"fingerprint":"73c5da0a","descriptors":[{"addressType":"p2wpkh","external":"wpkh([73c5da0a/84h/0h/0h]xpub.../0/*)#...","internal":"wpkh(.../1/*)#..."},...]}}
```

On-chain sends signal BIP 125 replace-by-fee, so an underpaying transaction
can later be bumped with `tx bump-fee` (or `tx boost`, which falls back to
CPFP when RBF is unavailable).

**Daily spend limit (combined):** when the daemon is started with
`--daily-spend-limit`, `send` and `send-max` count amount + fee against the
SAME daily budget as Lightning payments and fail with
`SPENDING_LIMIT_EXCEEDED` once it is exhausted. This limit was previously
Lightning-only. The ledger is persisted, so a daemon restart within the UTC
day resumes the day's total rather than starting it at zero.
`consolidate`, channel funding and `tx bump-fee`/`tx boost`
are not counted. Frozen UTXOs are excluded from every send path (`send`,
`send-max`, `consolidate`, `psbt build`) until unfrozen.

**Multi-account and wallet birthday (library only):** `Wallet.create` accepts
`account` (BIP32 account index, default 0; per-account storage isolation) and
`birthdayHeight` (persisted creation-height metadata, exported with
descriptors). The daemon always runs a single account-0 wallet and does not
expose either option. `birthdayHeight` cannot speed up Electrum scans (the
protocol has no height-filtered history), it is recorded for future backends
and external tooling.

The on-chain wallet's state (addresses, UTXOs, transactions) persists in the
node's SQLite database (encrypted at rest when `storageEncryption` is on, the
default), so restarts sync incrementally from Electrum instead of rebuilding
the wallet from scratch.

### Peers

```bash
beignet peer connect <pubkey> <host> <port>
beignet peer disconnect <pubkey>
beignet peer list
```

### DNS Bootstrap (BOLT 10)

```bash
beignet bootstrap discover
# {"ok":true,"result":[{"pubkey":"02ab...","host":"1.2.3.4","port":9735},...]}

beignet bootstrap connect 5
# {"ok":true,"result":{"connected":["02ab...","03cd..."]}}
```

### Trusted Peers (Zero-Conf)

```bash
beignet trusted-peer add <pubkey>
# {"ok":true,"result":{"pubkey":"02ab...","trusted":true}}

beignet trusted-peer remove <pubkey>
# {"ok":true,"result":{"pubkey":"02ab...","trusted":false}}

beignet trusted-peer list
# {"ok":true,"result":[{"pubkey":"02ab...","trusted":true}]}
```

The set is durable: it is written to the wallet database on every add and
remove, and reloaded at startup before any peer can reconnect. Membership is
symmetric and says this node will treat that peer's UNCONFIRMED funding as a
usable channel, so it is also what makes an inbound zero-conf open acceptable.
An acceptor that does not carry the opener refuses a zero_conf open outright
rather than downgrading it to a confirmed one, which is why a wallet receiving
through a JIT LSP has to carry that LSP here.

### Channels

```bash
beignet channel open <pubkey> <sats> [pushSats]
beignet channel open-zeroconf <pubkey> <sats> [pushSats]
beignet channel open-v2 <pubkey> <sats> [fundingFeeratePerkw] [--request-funds <sats>] [--blockheight <n>] [--max-lease-rates '<json>']
# The lease flags buy inbound liquidity (option_will_fund) at or under the
# given rate ceiling; --blockheight defaults to the node's current tip.
beignet channel open-and-wait <pubkey> <sats> [pushSats] [--timeout 60000]
beignet channel connect-and-open <pubkey> <host> <port> <sats> [pushSats]
beignet channel close <channelId> [--accept-stale-state-risk]
beignet channel forceclose <channelId> [--accept-stale-state-risk]
# Both closes pay out to a wallet-owned address the wallet scans (the current
# unused address when the wallet can produce one; consecutive closes may get
# the same address until it sees use), falling back to the startup sweep
# address and then the funding-key address, so the closed balance is tracked
# and spendable without a rescue sweep.
# A channel restored from a Recovery Capsule refuses either close without the
# flag. Cooperative: a mutual close pays out restored balances that cannot be
# proven current. Force: if the peer holds a newer state the broadcast is
# revoked and the whole channel balance goes to the justice path.
beignet channel rebroadcast-close <channelId>
beignet channel splice-in <channelId> <sats> <feeratePerkw>

beignet channel update-policy <channelId|all> [--base-fee-msat N] [--ppm N] [--cltv-delta N] [--htlc-min-msat N] [--htlc-max-msat N]

beignet channel get <channelId>
# channel get/list include the effective routing policy fields
beignet channel health <channelId>
beignet channel suggestions [count]
beignet channel wait-ready <channelId> [--timeout 60000]
```

### Routing Fee Policy

Per-channel control of the ROUTING policy advertised in `channel_update` (not
the commitment feerate, which is `/channel/update-commitment-feerate`): base
fee, proportional fee (ppm), CLTV delta, and HTLC min/max. Unset fields fall
back to the node-wide defaults; overrides persist across restarts. Announced
channels re-broadcast the updated `channel_update` immediately; unannounced
channels send it directly to the peer.

```bash
beignet channel update-policy ab12... --base-fee-msat 500 --ppm 100
# {"ok":true,"result":{"updated":1,"policies":[{"channelId":"ab12...","feeBaseMsat":500,"feeProportionalMillionths":100,"cltvExpiryDelta":40,"htlcMinimumMsat":"1000","htlcMaximumMsat":"500000000","source":"override"}]}}

beignet channel update-policy all --cltv-delta 80
# Applies to every channel; other fields keep their current values
```

### Forwarding History

Ledger of settled forwards (HTLCs this node relayed where both legs
fulfilled), with the fee earned per forward. Records persist in the node
database (capped at 100k rows, oldest pruned first). Msat values are decimal
strings. Failed forwards are not recorded.

```bash
beignet forwards --since 1751000000000 --limit 50
# {"ok":true,"result":[{"id":7,"settledAt":1751234567890,"inChannelId":"ab12...","outChannelId":"cd34...","amountInMsat":"5005000","amountOutMsat":"5000000","feeMsat":"5000"}]}

beignet forwards summary --since 1751000000000
# {"ok":true,"result":{"count":42,"volumeOutMsat":"210000000","feesEarnedMsat":"210000"}}
### Graph Queries

### BOLT 12 Offers

```bash

# {"ok":true,"result":{"offerId":"ab12...","description":"Coffee","amountSats":1000,"encoded":"lno1..."}}

beignet offer list

```

### Webhooks (CLI)

```bash
beignet webhooks register https://myagent.com/callback payment:received,channel:ready --secret mysecret
beignet webhooks register https://myagent.com/callback '*'
# '*' subscribes to every event, including any added in future versions
beignet webhooks list
beignet webhooks unregister <id>
```

Most daemon endpoints have a CLI command. HTTP-only exceptions include `GET /events` (SSE stream for long-lived consumers; use `webhooks` from
the CLI instead) and `GET /openapi.json` (machine-readable API discovery). The
deprecated `POST /channel/update-fee` alias is covered by
`channel update-commitment-feerate`. The app-driven FFOR lifecycle uses
`/ffor/*` and `/receive/*` directly over HTTP. `GET /receive/quote` answers with
a `mode` and `POST /receive/invoice` with a matching `kind`: `bolt11` when a
channel that already exists with that peer can carry the payment offline, and
`direct-funding` otherwise, which returns a direct-funding `request` instead of
an invoice. Automatic receiving never opens a channel to obtain inbound
liquidity. See
[automatic receiving](../../docs/AUTOMATIC-OFFLINE-RECEIVE.md#daemon-api) for
the durable invoice preparation and reconciliation API.

### JSON Envelope

Every response follows this format:

```json
// Success
{"ok": true, "result": { ... }}

// Failure
{"ok": false, "error": {"code": "PAYMENT_FAILED", "message": "No route found"}}
```

| `BEIGNET_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_MS` | Timeout for `connectPeer()` in milliseconds (default: 15000) |
| `BEIGNET_TLS_CERT` | Path to TLS certificate for HTTPS daemon |
| `BEIGNET_TLS_KEY` | Path to TLS private key for HTTPS daemon |
| `BEIGNET_TOR_PROXY` | SOCKS5 proxy as `host:port` for outbound Lightning peer and watchtower connections (e.g. Tor at `127.0.0.1:9050`); `.onion` peers need one. Unset, `.onion` peers fall back to `127.0.0.1:9050` and everything else is dialed directly |
| `BEIGNET_TOR_PROXY_ONION_ONLY` | `true` to use `BEIGNET_TOR_PROXY` for `.onion` hosts only and dial public clearnet hosts directly (hybrid mode, LND's `tor.skip-proxy-for-clearnet-targets`); exact `true`/`false`, anything else is ignored. Needs `BEIGNET_TOR_PROXY`, or startup is refused |
| `BEIGNET_HTLC_EVENTS` | `true` to relay per-HTLC events over SSE + webhooks |
| `BEIGNET_EAGER_GOSSIP_VERIFY` | `true` to verify foreign gossip signatures at intake instead of lazily at serve time (default: lazy; exact `true`/`false`, anything else is ignored) |
| `BEIGNET_LOG_LEVEL` | Daemon stderr log level: `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, `silent` (default: silent) |
| `BEIGNET_RECOVERY_MODE` | Recovery Protocol mode: `off`, `peer-storage`, `async-remote`, `quorum` (default: off; unknown values fall back to off) |
| `BEIGNET_RECOVERY_GUARDIANS` | Guardian set for async-remote/quorum, comma-separated `<64-hex-x-only-pubkey>@<url>` where the URL is `http(s)://...` for an HTTP guardian or `bolt8://<66-hex node id>@host:port` for a guardian hosted by a beignet node (crash-v1: exactly three; malformed entries refuse startup) |
| `BEIGNET_RECOVERY_PROFILE` | Recovery fault-model profile; `crash-v1` is the only accepted value and the default |
| `BEIGNET_RECOVERY_LEASE_CHECK_MS` | Guardian modes: idle writer lease re-check cadence in ms, an integer in 0..2147483647 (default: 300000; 0 disables; anything else refuses startup) |
| `BEIGNET_RECOVERY_REESTABLISH_HOLD_MS` | peer-storage mode: how long an unknown channel's `channel_reestablish` is held before the BOLT 1 error goes out, an integer in 0..2147483647 (default: 600000; 0 answers immediately; anything else refuses startup) |
| `BEIGNET_GUARDIAN_SERVE` | `true` to serve the reference guardian to other beignet nodes over bolt8 sessions at this node's Lightning address (docs/RECOVERY-GUARDIAN-WIRE.md 2.7); needs `BEIGNET_LISTEN_PORT`. Independent of this node's own recovery mode, and kept serving while this node's own writer lease is quarantined |
| `BEIGNET_GUARDIAN_TOKEN` | Bearer token every guardian session must present; unset runs open (BOLT 8 already encrypts and authenticates the host, so the token is an allow-list) |
| `BEIGNET_GUARDIAN_MAX_BYTES` | Hard bound on the content one served guardian set may store (its encoded rows; SQLite's overhead comes on top): every write, epoch rows and rotations included, that would cross it is refused with `ERR_QUOTA_EXCEEDED` (default 268435456). Refuses, never deletes |
| `BEIGNET_GUARDIAN_MAX_SETS` | Guardian sets this node will register (default 16) |
| `BEIGNET_GUARDIAN_MAX_CIPHERTEXT_BYTES` | Advertised per-record ciphertext limit (default 4194304; protocol cap 16 MiB) |
| `BEIGNET_RECOVERY_AUTO_APPLY` | peer-storage mode: on a boot whose database is empty, apply the best Recovery Capsule the storage peers return with no operator call and rebuild the node in-process on it (exact `true`/`false`; default off; refused outside peer-storage mode). Cannot fence a previous device that still runs |
| `BEIGNET_RECOVERY_AUTO_APPLY_SETTLE_MS` | Auto-apply settle floor from the first capsule's arrival, so a slower replica still competes for the selection (default: 15000) |
| `BEIGNET_RECOVERY_AUTO_APPLY_MAX_WAIT_MS` | Auto-apply ceiling from the first arrival; storage peers that never connect are not waited for past it (default: 120000; must be at least the settle floor and below `BEIGNET_RECOVERY_REESTABLISH_HOLD_MS`) |
| `BEIGNET_FEE_BASE_MSAT` | Node-wide default routing base fee advertised in `channel_update`, an integer in 0..4294967295 msat (default: 1000; anything else refuses startup). Per-channel `channel update-policy` overrides win |
| `BEIGNET_FEE_PPM` | Node-wide default proportional routing fee in millionths, an integer in 0..4294967295 (default: 1; anything else refuses startup). Per-channel overrides win |
| `BEIGNET_CLTV_DELTA` | Node-wide default forwarding CLTV delta, an integer in 1..65535, `>= 18` recommended (default: 40; anything else refuses startup). Per-channel overrides win |
| `BEIGNET_LEASE_RATES` | Liquidity ads (`option_will_fund`) seller policy: a JSON object `{"fundingWeightWitness":n,"leaseFeeBasis":n,"leaseFeeBaseSat":n,"channelFeeMaxBaseMsat":n,"channelFeeMaxProportionalThousandths":n}` (u16/u16/u32/u32/u16). Setting it sells inbound liquidity at these rates and advertises the feature bit; malformed or out-of-range values refuse startup; unset means never sell |
| `BEIGNET_JIT_RECEIVE` | JIT channel receive, LSP role: hold HTLCs addressed to intercept SCIDs registered by wallet peers, fund a zero-conf channel with THIS node's coins, then forward (`true`/`false`, default off) |
| `BEIGNET_JIT_FLAT_FEE_SAT` | Flat part of the opening fee the LSP role deducts from a JIT delivery, an integer in 0..4294967295 (default 0) |
| `BEIGNET_JIT_FEE_PPM` | Proportional part of that fee in millionths of the delivered total, an integer in 0..1000000 (default 0) |
| `BEIGNET_JIT_MAX_FLAT_FEE_SAT` | Wallet role: most an LSP may quote `POST /jit/invoice` as a flat fee before the intent is refused (default 10000) |
| `BEIGNET_JIT_MAX_FEE_PPM` | Wallet role: most an LSP may quote as a proportional fee, in millionths (default 50000). Applies whether or not the LSP role is on |
| `BEIGNET_JIT_MAX_CLIENT_FUNDING_SAT` | LSP role: most this node fronts for ONE client, open or splice (default 1000000; a partly numeric value refuses startup) |
| `BEIGNET_JIT_MAX_CONCURRENT_FUNDINGS` | LSP role: fundings (opens plus splices) allowed in flight at once, an integer in 0..1000 (default 3). With the per-client cap this bounds what is committed at any instant |
| `BEIGNET_JIT_MAX_TOTAL_FUNDING_SAT` | LSP role: lifetime budget of sats this node may ever front, counted across restarts (default unset, meaning no lifetime budget: exposure at any instant is bounded by the two caps above) |
| `BEIGNET_SWAPS` | Reverse swap provider role (issue #737): a peer pays this node a hold invoice, this node funds a P2WSH contract the peer claims on chain, and the claim's preimage settles the hold (`true`/`false`, default off: the role locks THIS node's coins in contracts for peers) |
| `BEIGNET_SWAP_FLAT_FEE_SAT` | Flat part of the swap fee, sats (default 0) |
| `BEIGNET_SWAP_FEE_PPM` | Proportional part of the swap fee in millionths of the on-chain amount (default 0). The quoted funding miner fee is added to both |
| `BEIGNET_SWAP_MIN_SAT` / `BEIGNET_SWAP_MAX_SAT` | Smallest and largest on-chain amount served (defaults 10000 / 1000000) |
| `BEIGNET_SWAP_MAX_EXPOSURE_SAT` | Most principal this node will have at risk on chain across unresolved swaps at once (default 5000000) |
| `BEIGNET_SWAP_MAX_CONCURRENT` | Unresolved swaps allowed at once, unpaid ones included (default 8) |
| `BEIGNET_SWAP_REFUND_DELTA_BLOCKS` | Blocks from create to the contract's refund height (default 144). The hold invoice's final CLTV is derived from it so a paid hold always outlives the refund |
| `BEIGNET_SWAP_FUNDING_CONFS` / `BEIGNET_SWAP_RESOLUTION_CONFS` | Depth the funding needs before it counts, and depth a claim or refund needs before it is the outcome (defaults 1 / 3). A claim settles the hold at any depth, the mempool included; a refund cancels it only at this depth. Both directions share these |
| `BEIGNET_SWAP_SUBMARINE` | With `BEIGNET_SWAPS=true`, also serve the submarine direction (issue #743): a peer locks coins in a P2WSH contract whose preimage branch is this node's, this node pays the peer's own invoice once the funding has confirmed to `BEIGNET_SWAP_FUNDING_CONFS` and been re-verified unspent, with every HTLC bound to the refund height minus the claim margins, and claims the coins with the preimage. Exact `true`/`false`, default off: the node pays out Lightning funds against a contract it must then claim. The fee terms and exposure caps above apply to both directions |
| `BEIGNET_SWAP_CLAIM_SAFETY_BLOCKS` | Blocks between the last possible outgoing HTLC expiry and the peer's refund height, for a late preimage to be claimed and confirmed (default 24) |
| `BEIGNET_SWAP_PAYMENT_MAX_FEE_PPM` | Routing fee this node may spend on the payment, per million of the invoice (default 5000); charged into the swap fee floor on top of the flat, ppm and claim miner fee |
| `BEIGNET_SWAP_CLAIM_BUMP_INTERVAL_BLOCKS` | Blocks an unconfirmed claim waits before it is rebuilt at a higher fee (default 2); inside the claim safety window the claim is bumped every block, up to the whole output above dust |
| `BEIGNET_SWAP_SUBMARINE_REFUND_DELTA_BLOCKS` | Blocks from a submarine create to its refund height (default 288, bounds 144 to 432); an invoice whose final CLTV plus a 72 block route budget cannot fit under the refund height minus the margins is refused as `CLTV_UNFITTABLE` |
| `BEIGNET_DF_RELAY` | Relay direct-funding frames for OTHER nodes (`true`/`false`, default off). Paying and being paid needs nothing switched on; this is work done for strangers, metered but not free |
| `BEIGNET_DF_MIN_AMOUNT` | Smallest direct-funding offer this node serves, a whole number of satoshis. Clamps up to the 5000 sat protocol floor; a partly numeric value refuses startup |

### Tor proxy

`BEIGNET_TOR_PROXY` (`--tor-proxy`, config key `torProxy`) sets the SOCKS5
proxy for outbound peer and watchtower connections. On its own it proxies every
public host, which hides the node's clearnet address from its peers at the cost
of Tor's latency on every dial. `BEIGNET_TOR_PROXY_ONION_ONLY=true`
(`--tor-proxy-onion-only`, config key `torProxyOnionOnly`) keeps the proxy for
`.onion` hosts only, so a node can reach onion peers through a Tor that lives
elsewhere (a separate container, say) while dialing clearnet peers directly.
It needs `BEIGNET_TOR_PROXY`: set alone it has nothing to act on and startup is
refused. Private and loopback hosts are dialed directly in every case, because
Tor refuses them.

| Destination | proxy alone | proxy plus onion-only |
|---|---|---|
| `.onion` | proxy | proxy |
| private or loopback | direct | direct |
| public clearnet | proxy | direct |

Guardian sessions over bolt8 already dial only onion hosts through the proxy.

### Priority Order

CLI flags > environment variables > config file > defaults.

### Default Electrum Servers

| Network | Host | Port | TLS |
|---------|------|------|-----|
| mainnet | `fulcrum.bitkit.blocktank.to` | 8900 | yes |
| testnet | `electrum.blockstream.info` | 60002 | yes |
| regtest | `34.65.252.32` | 18483 | no |

> The regtest default is a hosted Synonym regtest Electrum server. For local
> development against your own regtest node, override it with

## HTTP API

The daemon exposes these endpoints on `127.0.0.1:2112` (configurable via `daemonHost`/`daemonPort`). All POST endpoints accept JSON bodies. HTTPS is supported when started with `--tls-cert` and `--tls-key`.

These endpoints support the `X-Idempotency-Key` header (24h cache): `/invoice/pay`, `/invoice/pay-safe`, `/invoice/pay-async`, `/invoice/pay-retry`, `/keysend`, `/keysend/safe`, `/l402/fetch`, `/rebalance`, `/advisor/execute-rebalances`, `/direct-funding/send`, `/send`, `/send-max`. A repeat with the same key and body returns the cached response; the same key with a different body returns `409 IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT`. The cache is in memory, so it does not survive a daemon restart.

### Authentication

Two kinds of credentials, usable together:

- **Legacy single token** -- `apiToken` (via `--api-token`, `BEIGNET_API_TOKEN`, or config file). Backward compatible: it keeps working and carries an implicit `admin` scope.
- **Named scoped keys** -- the `apiKeys` config array (or `BEIGNET_API_KEYS` env var as JSON): `[{ "name": "monitor", "key": "<secret>", "scopes": ["readonly"], "expiresAt": "2027-01-01T00:00:00Z" }, ...]`. A key may hold multiple scopes; `expiresAt` is optional.

When any credential is configured, all endpoints require an `Authorization: Bearer <token-or-key-secret>` header. Exceptions (always accessible):

- `GET /health`, `GET /ready` -- monitoring tools
- `GET /openapi.json` -- API discovery
- `GET /metrics` -- Prometheus scrapers

If neither `apiToken` nor `apiKeys` is configured, all endpoints are open (backward-compatible). `GET /mnemonic` is only accessible when auth is configured (and only to `admin`).

**Scopes:**

| Scope | Grants |
|-------|--------|
| `readonly` | Every GET route (except `GET /mnemonic` and `GET /webhooks`) plus POSTs that are pure queries: estimate/validate/decode/verify and the wait endpoints. |
| `invoice` | Receive-side routes: creating invoices/offers/hold invoices, settling/cancelling holds, `POST /address/new`, invoice/offer lookups and decoding, `GET /can-receive`, `POST /payment/wait`, and the `GET /events` SSE stream. |
| `admin` | Everything, including paying/spending, channel and peer management, PSBTs, backups, webhooks management, `POST /stop`, and API key management. |

Every route is explicitly classified in `src/cli/auth.ts` (`ROUTE_SCOPES`); a drift test fails the build if a new route ships without a classification, and unclassified routes fail closed (admin-only). Notable classifications: all webhook routes including `GET /webhooks` are admin-only (callback URLs can embed credentials; management is one unit); `POST /message/sign` is admin-only because it signs with the node identity key; `GET /events` (SSE) accepts `readonly` and `invoice`.

Key comparison is constant-time (SHA-256 digests compared with `crypto.timingSafeEqual`), for the legacy token too. Failures return **401** `UNAUTHORIZED` for a bad or missing key and **403** `FORBIDDEN` for a valid key without a required scope.

**Expiry:** a named key may declare `expiresAt` (ISO 8601, e.g. `"2027-01-01T00:00:00Z"`). From that moment the key fails authentication exactly like an unknown key (401); the check happens on every request, so no restart is needed. An unparseable `expiresAt` is rejected at daemon startup (`INVALID_PARAMS`). `GET /auth/keys` reports `expiresAt` and a computed `expired` boolean per key.

**Rotation:** `POST /auth/keys/rotate {"name": "..."}` (`beignet auth rotate <name>`, admin scope) mints a cryptographically random 32-byte hex secret for an existing named key. The old secret stops authenticating immediately; scopes and expiry are unchanged. The new secret appears ONCE in the response -- only its SHA-256 digest is stored, so it cannot be retrieved again; if it is lost, rotate again. Rotating a revoked key reinstates it under the new secret (the old, possibly compromised secret stays dead).

**Persistence:** rotation and revocation are written to the node database (the encrypted `wallet_data` table -- digests only, never plaintext secrets) and are re-applied over the config-declared keys on every start. This fixes the earlier limitation where revocation was in-memory only and a daemon restart resurrected a revoked key. The config file remains the source of truth for the key *set*: overrides apply by name, an override whose name left the config is pruned, and editing a key's secret in the config discards any stored rotation/revocation for that name (an explicit config re-key wins). Removing a key from the config file remains the ultimate cleanup.

**Legacy token caveats:** the single `apiToken` has no name, so it can be neither rotated nor expired nor revoked at runtime -- its behavior is unchanged. To retire it, change or remove it in the config and restart. Prefer named `apiKeys` for anything that needs lifecycle management.

| POST | `/channel/rebroadcast-close` | `{ channelId }` | Rebroadcast the recorded close tx of a force-closed channel (or an unconfirmed mutual close); idempotent, always rebuilds from the latest state |
| POST | `/channel/splice-in` | `{ channelId, amountSats, feeratePerkw }` | Splice-in funds. A 2xx means the splice started; a refusal is a failure envelope (404 `CHANNEL_NOT_FOUND`, 409 `SPLICING_NOT_NEGOTIATED` / `FUNDING_PROVIDER_REQUIRED` / `SPLICE_REFUSED`, 503 `SPLICE_BUSY`, 400 `INVALID_PARAMS`) |
| POST | `/channel/splice-out` | `{ channelId, amountSats, feeratePerkw, address? }` | Splice-out funds, optionally to an external address. Same refusal codes, plus 409 `INSUFFICIENT_BALANCE` |
| POST | `/invoice/create` | `{ amountSats?, description?, minFinalCltvExpiry? }` | Create invoice (omit amountSats for amount-less; `minFinalCltvExpiry` buys final-CLTV headroom for a receive an LSP may settle through a splice) |
| POST | `/jit/invoice` | `{ lspPubkey, amountSats?, description?, expirySecs?, targetRemainingInboundSat?, maxFlatFeeSat?, maxFeePpm? }` | Create an invoice payable with no channel: registers a receive intent with the LSP, which funds a channel mid-payment and deducts the quoted opening fee. Returns the invoice plus `flatFeeSat` and `feePpm` |
| GET | `/jit/status` | -- | The JIT receive role as it stands: `enabled`, the client ceilings, and (when on) `lsp` with the opening fee, the exposure caps, sats reserved and fronted, live intents, held HTLCs and fundings in flight. Readonly scope |
| GET | `/jit/quote` | `?lspPubkey=&amountSats=&targetRemainingInboundSat=` | Price a JIT receive at that LSP without registering an intent: `accepted`, a plain-language `reason` when declined, `flatFeeSat`, `feePpm`, `feeSats` on this amount, `fundingSats` the LSP would front, `maxClientFundingSats`, and `withinCeilings` against this node's own limits. The LSP must be connected (409 `PEER_NOT_CONNECTED`, 504 `JIT_TIMEOUT`). Readonly scope |
| GET | `/swaps/status` | -- | Swap provider (issues #737 and #743): `enabled`, and when on the fee terms, exposure caps, timing, reverse swaps per state and `exposedSat` at risk on chain; `submarine` reports the on-chain to Lightning direction the same way (`enabled: false` when it is off). Readonly scope |
| GET | `/swaps` | `?id=<hex>` | The swap ledger (or one swap) in both directions (`direction` is `reverse` or `submarine`): state, contract terms, funding, payment, claim, refund and resolution facts; amounts as decimal strings, no private key. Readonly scope |
| POST | `/swaps/cancel` | `{ id }` | Cancel a swap before any funds moved: a reverse swap in CREATED or HELD (closes its hold invoice), a submarine swap before PAYING (the peer refunds its own coins at the refund height). Answers `{ id, cancelled: true }`; past that a swap resolves on chain by claim or refund (409 `SWAP_NOT_CANCELLABLE`). Admin scope |
| POST | `/direct-funding/configure` | `{ lspPubkey?, lspHost?, lspPort?, targetInboundSat?, trusted?, allowSplice?, allowUnpairedSplice?, unpairedSpliceDepth?, minAmountSat? }` | Set the direct-funding policy. A partial MERGE, never a replace: a field the body does not name keeps its value. `trusted` lets an open go zero-conf; `allowSplice` lets a paired payer grow the existing channel with the liquidity peer instead of opening a second one; `allowUnpairedSplice` lets an anonymous payer do the same when its coin is confirmed, with a splice that locks at `unpairedSpliceDepth` confirmations (1..2016, default 3) rather than at broadcast, whatever the channel type (an anonymous payer with an unconfirmed coin still gets a new confirmed channel). While a splice with the liquidity peer is still confirming, every further offer is declined before the payer's witness leaves, so the payer falls back to a plain send. The three switches must be booleans (400 `INVALID_PARAMS` otherwise). `minAmountSat` clamps up to the 5000 sat floor and the response reports the clamped value. Returns the full effective config |
| GET | `/direct-funding/config` | -- | Read the effective policy, `allowUnpairedSplice` and `unpairedSpliceDepth` included; `lspPubkey` is null when no liquidity peer is set, in which case no offer is served |
| POST | `/direct-funding/request` | `{ host?, port?, amountSats? }` | Mint a payment request: returns `{ paymentHash, expiresAt, request }`, where `request` is the base64url envelope a payer pays (BIP 21 parameter `bgnq`). `host`/`port` are the address a payer can reach this node on and are used exactly as given |
| POST | `/direct-funding/prepare` | `{ request }` | Decode a request and start connecting to the node a send would talk to first, without waiting for the dial. Returns `{ requestId, receiverNodeId, amountSat, expiresAt, connection, peerNodeId? }`, where `connection` is `connected`, `connecting`, `awaiting_receiver` or `none`. Spends nothing and writes no payment record; a later `send` joins a dial still in progress. Admin scope |
| POST | `/direct-funding/send` | `{ request, amountSats?, maxTotalFeeSat?, recoverReceipt? }` | Pay a request from one of our coins. Set `recoverReceipt` to ask the receiver to replay a receipt that never arrived (issue #767): it acts only on a post-witness payment with no receipt yet, re-sends the recorded offer with no second coin, signature or freeze, and returns the recorded outcome plus a `caveat` if the receiver cannot be reached. **Rejects only before our witness leaves the device**; after that it resolves with what is known plus a `caveat`, because a client that falls back to a plain on-chain send on any error cannot tell a late rejection from an early one and would pay twice. Idempotent on the request id, sets no deadline of its own, and accepts `feeHeadroomSats` as an alias for `maxTotalFeeSat`. The money leaves for a stranger's channel, so amount + fee ceiling counts against the combined daily spend limit, and a draining node refuses it (both before the exchange opens, and neither for a request that already has an attempt: a duplicate call spends nothing new, and refusing one would be read as "nothing happened") |
| POST | `/invoice/create-hold` | `{ paymentHash, amountMsat?, amountSats?, description?, expiry?, minFinalCltvExpiry? }` | Create hold invoice for a caller-supplied payment hash (HTLCs park until settle/cancel). `minFinalCltvExpiry` is 1..2016 blocks; on a swap leg it has to clear the on-chain refund timeout plus the 18-block hold cancellation margin and the refund's own resolution time |
| POST | `/invoice/settle-hold` | `{ preimage }` | Settle a parked hold invoice (fulfills all MPP parts) |
| POST | `/invoice/cancel-hold` | `{ paymentHash }` | Cancel a hold invoice; fails parked HTLCs back |
| GET | `/invoices/held` | -- | List hold invoices with state + parked totals. Each row also carries `minFinalCltvExpiry` (the delta the invoice advertised and the final hop enforces on every arriving HTLC) and the realised expiry of the parked set: `earliestExpiry`, `cancelMarginBlocks` and `cancelHeight` (null before any part is committed). A swap provider checks `earliestExpiry` against its on-chain refund timeout before funding instead of trusting the advertised delta |
| POST | `/invoice/decode` | `{ bolt11 }` | Decode invoice |
| POST | `/invoice/pay` | `{ bolt11, timeoutMs?, maxFeeSats?, amountSats?, metadata?, cltvLimit? }` | Pay invoice (`amountSats` for amount-less invoices, `metadata` for labels). `cltvLimit` bounds the payment's total CLTV expiry in blocks above the current tip; no route under it answers `409 CLTV_EXCEEDS_MAX` with nothing sent, and a node without a tip yet answers `503 CHAIN_NOT_SYNCED`. |
| POST | `/invoice/pay-safe` | `{ bolt11, timeoutMs?, maxFeeSats?, amountSats?, metadata?, cltvLimit? }` | Pay invoice; resolves with `status: 'FAILED'` on failure instead of error. |
| POST | `/invoice/pay-retry` | `{ bolt11, maxRetries?, backoffMs?, maxFeeSats?, amountSats?, metadata?, cltvLimit? }` | Pay with exponential backoff retry. Returns `RetryPaymentResult` with `attempts`. |
| POST | `/invoice/pay-async` | `{ bolt11, maxFeeSats?, amountSats?, metadata?, cltvLimit? }` | Fire-and-forget pay; returns `{ paymentHash, status }` immediately. Poll `GET /payment` for settlement. Answers 409 while draining and 403 over a spending limit. A refusal carries the same code and status as `/invoice/pay`: 409 `DUPLICATE_PAYMENT` for a hash already paid or still in flight, 502 `NO_ROUTE`, 400 `INVALID_INVOICE`, and so on, never a bare 502 `PAYMENT_FAILED` (issue #991). |

| GET | `/graph/channel` | `?scid=<BxTxO or hex>` | Channel endpoints, capacity and both directions' policies (404 if unknown) |
| GET | `/graph/describe` | `?limit=&offset=` | Paged channel dump (limit defaults to 500, capped at 500) |
| POST | `/route/query` | `{ destination, amountSats, maxFeeSats? }` | Compute a route WITHOUT sending; hops feed `/payment/send-to-route` |

| POST | `/channel/update-fee` | `{ channelId, feeratePerKw }` | Deprecated alias for `/channel/update-commitment-feerate` |
| POST | `/channel/update-policy` | `{ channelId?, all?, feeBaseMsat?, feeProportionalMillionths?, cltvExpiryDelta?, htlcMinimumMsat?, htlcMaximumMsat? }` | Set ROUTING fee policy per channel (or `all: true`); regenerates + re-broadcasts channel_update |
| GET | `/channel/policy` | `?channelId=<hex>` | Effective routing policy (override or node defaults) with `source` field |
| POST | `/node/wait-ready` | `{ timeoutMs? }` | Wait for node to be fully operational (default 30s) |

| POST | `/webhooks/register` | `{ url, events, secret? }` | Register webhook callback |
| DELETE | `/webhooks/unregister` | `{ id }` | Remove webhook |
| GET | `/webhooks` | -- | List registered webhooks |

| GET | `/queue` | -- | List payment queue |
| POST | `/queue/cancel` | `{ id }` | Cancel queued payment |
| POST | `/keysend` | `{ pubkey, amountSats, timeoutMs?, maxFeeSats?, metadata? }` | Spontaneous payment (no invoice). Blocks until settled. |
| POST | `/keysend/safe` | `{ pubkey, amountSats, timeoutMs?, maxFeeSats?, metadata? }` | Keysend that never errors — resolves with `status: 'FAILED'` instead. |
| GET | `/spend-limit` | -- | COMBINED LN + on-chain daily spend limit status: `{ totalSats, lightningSats, onchainSats, limitSats, remainingSats, pendingSats, resetsAt, spentSats }` (`spentSats` mirrors `totalSats` for back-compat; `pendingSats` is what in-flight payments hold and `remainingSats` subtracts it). Persisted: the figures survive a restart within the UTC day, and a payment that settles after a timeout or a restart is still counted once |
| GET | `/auth/keys` | -- | List named API keys: names, scopes, revoked/expired flags, expiresAt/rotatedAt (never secrets; admin scope) |
| POST | `/auth/keys/revoke` | `{ name }` | Disable a named API key immediately (admin scope; persisted, survives restarts) |
| POST | `/auth/keys/rotate` | `{ name }` | Mint a new random secret for a named key; returned once, old secret dies immediately (admin scope; persisted) |
| GET | `/recovery/status` | -- | Recovery Protocol status: mode, guardian set, daemon state (`disabled`/`running`/`restore-required`/`restoring`/`restart-required`/`fenced`), the node view (startup gate, durability, last durable sequence, per-channel recovery status), and the Recovery Capsules storage peers returned this session (`capsules`, whose `best` names the guardian locators the capsule carries, credentials redacted), plus `autoApply` (the automatic capsule application: enabled, phase, settleUntil, lastReason). 404 on an older daemon = predates the feature; 200 with `disabled` = supported but off |
| POST | `/recovery/restore` | `{ confirm: true }` | Restore from guardian replicas and start the node on the restored state (restore-pending daemons only; channels RESUME instead of force-closing; the takeover permanently fences the previous writer). Progress streams over SSE as `recovery:restore-progress` |
| POST | `/recovery/restore-capsule` | `{ confirm: true, unfenced?: boolean }` | Peer-storage mode: restore from the Recovery Capsules storage peers returned this session. Tier 2 installs the exact state into a fresh database and holds the daemon until a restart (503 `NODE_RESTART_REQUIRED` elsewhere); Tier 1 recovers the embedded SCB on the live node. Progress streams over SSE as `recovery:restore-progress` |
| GET | `/guardian/status` | -- | The guardian this node serves to others: `{ serving }` plus guardian id, token requirement, sessions, served sets (members, namespaces, bytes) and limits |
| POST | `/recovery/rotate-guardians` | `{ guardians: [3 entries], confirm: true }` | Move this wallet to a new guardian set (one member or all three) with the channels running (wire 5.9): register with the incoming set under the current lease at the next generation, backfill, switch, retire the outgoing set. The env keeps naming the old set until updated; the journal's set is in force and the status route reports `configuredSetStale` |
| POST | `/recovery/resolve-guardian` | `{ uri }` | A beignet node's `<node id>@host:port` to a guardian entry `<guardianId>@bolt8://<node id>@host:port`, by asking its guardian over a bolt8 session. Adopts nothing |
| POST | `/recovery/capsule-guardians` | `{ confirm: true }` | The guardian set the best retrieved capsule names, INCLUDING transport credentials, as config-file entries for `recoveryGuardians`. The status route redacts credentials; this admin handoff is how a seed restore whose guardians need authentication gets them back. Nothing is adopted or persisted |
| POST | `/stop` | `{ drain?, drainTimeoutMs? }` | Stop daemon. `drain: true` waits for in-flight payments before shutting down. |

### Server-Sent Events (SSE)

`GET /events` opens a persistent connection that streams events as they occur:

```
event: payment:received
data: {"paymentHash":"ab12...","amountSats":1000,"status":"COMPLETED"}

event: channel:ready
data: {"channelId":"cd34..."}
```

Events relayed to SSE clients and webhooks: `payment:received`, `payment:sent`, `payment:failed`, `invoice:settled`, the hold-invoice lifecycle (`hold:accepted`, `hold:settled`, `hold:cancelled`), `channel:opening`, `channel:ready`, `channel:pending-close`, `channel:force-closing`, `channel:closed`, `channel:resolved` (terminal: every on-chain output of the close irrevocably swept), the splice lifecycle `splice:complete`, `splice:aborted`, `splice:conflicted`, `splice:reverted` (issue #760: a depth-locked splice whose input was spent elsewhere is reverted to the old funding by agreement with the peer; payloads carry `channelId` plus `spliceTxid`/`conflictTxid` in display order where they exist), `peer:connect`, `peer:disconnect`, `node:ready`, and the Recovery Protocol events `recovery:durable`, `recovery:fenced`, `recovery:backfill-lost`, `recovery:reestablish-held`, `recovery:capsule-retrieved`, `recovery:guardian_unreachable`, `recovery:restore-progress`, `recovery:restored` (always on; low volume, and operator dashboards ride them). JIT receive progress on the LSP side (`jit:intent`, `jit:intent-superseded`, `jit:intercepted`, `jit:funding`, `jit:forwarded`, `jit:failed`; satoshi and millisatoshi figures as decimal strings) and direct-funding receiver progress (`direct-funding:offer:accepted` with `paired`, `direct-funding:offer:declined`, `direct-funding:offer:failed`, `direct-funding:offer:completed`) are relayed too (issue #669), so a dashboard follows a funding it fronts or receives without polling.

- `invoice:settled` fires when an invoice this node issued is paid. `payment:received` also covers spontaneous (keysend) receives, which have no invoice.
- `channel:force-closing` fires both when this node broadcasts its own commitment (`initiator: "local"`) and when a peer's unilateral close is detected on-chain (`initiator: "remote"`).
- The `hold:*` events carry `{paymentHash, state, heldAmountMsat, htlcCount, minFinalCltvExpiry, earliestExpiry, cancelMarginBlocks, cancelHeight}`, plus `reason` (`api` or `expiry-scan`) on `hold:cancelled`. The amount, count and expiry fields describe the set acted on. Terminal events retain these totals even though a subsequent `GET /invoices/held` row has zero parked parts. `hold:accepted` fires once per new MPP part with the running total. Before funding, require `BigInt(heldAmountMsat)` to cover the full expected amount. For an amountless invoice, use the amount agreed with the payer.

Per-HTLC events (`htlc:forwarded`, `htlc:fulfilled`, `htlc:failed`) are relayed only when the daemon is started with `--htlc-events` (config `htlcEvents: true`, env `BEIGNET_HTLC_EVENTS=true`); routing nodes generate one event per HTLC, so they are off by default.

A keepalive comment (`: keepalive`) is sent every 30 seconds to prevent proxy timeouts.

### Webhooks

For agent frameworks that prefer callbacks over persistent connections, register webhook URLs:

```bash
# Register a webhook
curl -X POST http://localhost:2112/webhooks/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"url": "https://myagent.com/callback", "events": ["payment:received"], "secret": "mysecret"}'
# {"ok":true,"result":{"id":"abc123...","url":"https://...","events":["payment:received"],...}}

# List webhooks
curl http://localhost:2112/webhooks
# {"ok":true,"result":[...]}

# Unregister
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:2112/webhooks/unregister \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"id": "abc123..."}'
```

Webhook deliveries are POST requests with JSON body `{ event, data, timestamp }`. When a `secret` is configured, an `X-Webhook-Signature: sha256=<hmac>` header is included for payload verification. Webhooks are persisted to SQLite and survive daemon restarts. Note: HMAC secrets are stored as hashes — re-register with a secret after restart if HMAC verification is needed.

Registering with `"events": ["*"]` matches every relayed event, including the invoice, channel-lifecycle, and (when `--htlc-events` is enabled) HTLC events, plus any event types added in future versions. The event list matches the SSE list above.

For each registration and payment hash, hold lifecycle deliveries run in order,
including the one retry after a failed delivery. Other payment hashes can proceed
independently. Retries retain the original payload and timestamp. Delivery is
best effort: a request can be received more than once, and an event is dropped
after both attempts fail. Handle duplicates without repeating funding and treat
`SETTLED` and `CANCELLED` as terminal. After a disconnect or missed delivery,
reconcile with `GET /invoices/held` before acting on an old acceptance event.

### API Versioning

All endpoints support an optional `/v1/` prefix for forward compatibility. The daemon strips the prefix automatically:

```
GET /v1/info       →  handled as  GET /info
POST /v1/invoice/pay  →  handled as  POST /invoice/pay
```

All responses include `X-API-Version: 1` header. Non-prefixed routes continue to work unchanged.

### CORS

Enable CORS with `cors: true` (allows all origins) or `cors: 'https://myapp.com'` (specific origin) in DaemonOptions. Wildcard CORS requires authentication: with `apiToken`/`apiKeys` unset, `cors: true` is refused at startup (any page the operator visits could otherwise drive the API); pass an explicit origin, configure auth, or set `insecure: true` to accept the risk.

```typescript
startDaemon({ cors: true, apiToken: '...' });  // Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
startDaemon({ cors: 'https://myapp.com' });    // specific origin
```

Handles `OPTIONS` preflight requests automatically (`GET, POST, DELETE, OPTIONS`). The allowed request headers are `Content-Type`, `Authorization` and `X-Idempotency-Key`, so a browser client can send keyed `POST` requests (the `X-Idempotency-Key` header is documented under [HTTP API](#http-api)).

# Interop suites against the Docker nodes. LND_REST_PORT / LND_REST_HOST (and
# LND_TAPROOT_REST_PORT / LND_TAPROOT_REST_HOST) move the endpoints; a suite
# whose LND is unreachable skips with a line naming the port, and
# INTEROP_REQUIRE_LND=1 / INTEROP_REQUIRE_LND_TAPROOT=1 fail instead of
# skipping. See "Interop testing" in the top-level README.
