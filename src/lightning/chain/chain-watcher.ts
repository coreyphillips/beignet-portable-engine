	 * Two-phase discovery of a restored channel's funding, for a watch whose
	 * recorded attempts the chain does not know.
	 *
	 * Phase one collects PROVISIONAL candidates: confirmed transactions in the
	 * funding script's history that pay that script and share an input with
	 * every attempt the record knows. That lineage is what identifies the
	 * funding, because neither the script nor the value can. See
	 * discoverAttemptInputs. Nothing is bound on it: an attacker cannot forge
	 * the lineage, but a candidate that merely looks like a replacement is
	 * still not known to be the one this channel ended up with.
	 *
	 * Phase two waits for one of those outputs to be SPENT, and binds to that
	 * one. The output pays a 2-of-2 of this channel's funding pubkeys, so a
	 * spend of it exists only because both parties signed one. Lineage says
	 * the coins came from this negotiation; the spend says the negotiation
	 * finished on this outpoint. A candidate that is never spent stays
	 * provisional, which is the honest answer: the channel is not forgotten,
	 * and nothing has shown which output is the one that funded it.
	 *
	 * `complete` is false when any history entry could not be read. An
	 * incomplete scan must never be reported as absence: a backend that fails
	 * selectively would otherwise run BOLT 2's forget clock against a funding
	 * that is sitting on chain.
	 *
	 * Reports the candidate set rather than writing it to the watch (issue
	 * #624). Every transaction in the history is an await this scan can be
	 * overtaken in, and the caller is where the scan-order check lives, so the
	 * result is applied there or not at all. `superseded` is that same check,
	 * so a scan already answered for stops fetching instead of reading out a
	 * history nothing will use.
