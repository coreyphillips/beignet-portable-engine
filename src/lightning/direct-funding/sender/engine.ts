/**
 * The direct-funding payer engine (issue #613, LFBW port #532 workstream 4D).
 *
 * The payer's job is small and entirely adversarial. It decodes an envelope it
 * was handed in a URI, offers one coin, and then reads a transaction a stranger
 * built and decides whether the bytes in front of it spend that coin the way it
 * agreed. If they do it signs and the money moves. If they do not it refuses and
 * nothing has happened.
 *
 * One rule shapes everything else here:
 *
 *   **After the witness leaves the device, this call can never reject.**
 *
 * Rev 2 states it as a MUST, and the LFBW app is why it is not academic: its
 * send handler wraps this call in a try/catch and, on ANY throw, falls back to a
 * plain on-chain send of the same amount to the same address. It has no way to
 * know whether the witness went out, and it cannot be given one, because a
 * transport hiccup and a protocol decline look identical from there. A rejection
 * after the witness is out is therefore a SECOND payment. The app can be written
 * that simply precisely because this promises never to do that.
 *
 * So `send` rejects only from the pre-witness paths: a malformed envelope, an
 * amount that does not resolve, no coin, no reachable transport, a decline, a
 * sign request that failed verification, or a timeout before the witness. Once
 * the witness has been emitted, every later problem, up to and including a
 * forged receipt or a lane that dies mid-frame, resolves with what is known and
 * a `caveat` saying what was lost.
