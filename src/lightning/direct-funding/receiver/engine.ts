/**
 * The direct-funding receiver engine (issue #612, LFBW port #532 workstream
 * 4C).
 *
 * A payer offers to spend one of its UTXOs into a funding transaction we
 * negotiate with our liquidity peer, and we come back with a transaction for
 * it to sign. The payer's on-chain payment IS our channel funding, either a
 * new v2 dual-funded channel or a splice into the one we already have. Which
 * one is the operator's call (`allowSplice`, `allowUnpairedSplice`), and a
 * payer we have not paired with splices only with a confirmed coin and only
 * into a splice that locks at `unpairedSpliceDepth` confirmations (issue
 * #760), so a stranger's input is held to the bar a new channel's funding is.
 *
 * What this engine does not do matters as much as what it does. It never holds
 * the payer's coin and never signs for it. It decides whether to spend a
 * session on the offer, verifies that the coin exists and that the payer
 * controls it, drives the interactive transaction to the point where the bytes
 * are final, attests to those bytes with the node identity key, and hands them
 * over.
 *
 * Two properties everything else is arranged around:
 *
 *  - At-least-once delivery, exactly-once effects. Every response is recorded
 *    per offer id; a duplicate offer with the same content replays the record
 *    and starts nothing, up to and including the receipt. An offer id reused
 *    with different content is refused, never served. The response log is
 *    per-process; what crosses a restart is on the request record itself (the
 *    attempt budget, the busy mark, the funding that mark left in flight, and
 *    the receipt a paid request replays). A re-sent offer whose funding is
 *    still owed a witness is served FROM that funding, never by opening a
 *    second one, and the witness itself is taken from that funding too, on the
 *    lane it names, so a payer that sends one once is still paid (issue #635).
 *  - Every failure path releases the concurrency slot, the outpoint
 *    reservation and any channel or splice the session started. The fork left
 *    a live channel behind on three separate failure paths (defect D5). A
 *    funding the channel REFUSES to release is the one exception, and it keeps
 *    the payer's witness obligation open rather than declaring the exchange
 *    over: delivering the witness is the only exit the channel left.
